Based on the New York Stock Exchange       Composite Transaction closing price of the Common Stock on that date ($10.24       per       share), the aggregate market value of such Common Stock was $18,202,524,119.

The shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock outstanding at       June 30, 2005 included shares owned by persons who may be deemed to be       "affiliates" of Ford.

We       review and present our business results in two sectors: Automotive and Financial       Services. Within these sectors, our business is divided into reportable segments       based upon the organizational structure that we use to evaluate performance       and       make decisions on resource allocation, as well as availability and materiality       of separate financial results consistent with that structure.          1           ITEM               1. Business (continued)       Our       Automotive and Financial Services segments are described in the table       below:      Business                 Sector   Reportable                 Segments   Description             Automotive:   The                 Americas   Primarily                 includes the sale of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles and                 related                 service parts in North America (the United States, Canada and Mexico)                 and                 Ford-brand vehicles and related service parts in South America; in                 each                 case, together with the associated costs to design, develop, manufacture                 and service these vehicles and parts.               Ford                 Europe and  Premier                 Automotive Group   Primarily                 includes the sale of Ford-brand vehicles and related service parts                 in                 Europe and Turkey and the sale of Premier Automotive Group ("PAG")                 brand                 vehicles (i.e., Volvo, Jaguar, Land Rover and Aston Martin) and related                 service parts throughout the world (including North and South America,                 Asia Pacific and Africa); in each case, together with the associated                 costs                 to design, develop, manufacture and service these vehicles and                 parts.               Ford                 Asia Pacific and Africa/Mazda   Primarily                 includes the sale of Ford-brand vehicles and related service parts                 in the                 Asia Pacific region and South Africa, together with the associated                 costs                 to design, develop, manufacture and service these vehicles and parts,                 and                 our share of the results of Mazda Motor Corporation (of which we                 own                 approximately 33.4%) and certain of our Mazda-related                 investments.             Financial                 Services:   Ford                 Motor Credit Company   Primarily                 includes vehicle-related financing, leasing, and                 insurance.      We       provide financial information (such as revenues, income, and assets) for each       of       these business sectors and reportable segments in three areas of this Report:       (1) "Item 6. Selected Financial Data", (2) "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and       Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", and (3) Note 24       of       the Notes to the Financial Statements located at the end of this Report.       Financial information relating to certain geographic areas also is included       in       these Notes.  AUTOMOTIVE       SECTOR  General         We       sell       cars and trucks throughout the world. In 2005, we sold approximately 6,818,000       vehicles throughout the world. Our automotive vehicle brands include Ford,       Mercury, Lincoln, Volvo, Land Rover, Jaguar and Aston Martin.  Substantially       all of our cars, trucks and parts are marketed through retail dealers in North       America, and through distributors and dealers outside of North America, the       substantial majority of which are independently owned. At December 31, 2005,       the       approximate number of dealers and distributors worldwide distributing our       vehicle brands was as follows:        Brand     Number                 of Dealerships at                 December 31, 2005*       Ford       10,134       Mercury       1,971       Lincoln       1,422       Volvo       2,400       Land                 Rover       1,400       Jaguar       880       Aston                 Martin       125       __________  * Because       many of these dealerships distribute more than one of our brands from the same       sales location, a single dealership may be counted under more than one       brand.         2        ITEM             1. Business (continued)       In       addition to the products we sell to our dealers for retail sale, we also sell       cars and trucks to our dealers for sale to fleet customers, including daily       rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and       governments. Sales to all of our fleet customers in the United States in the       aggregate have represented between 23% and 27% of our total U.S. car and truck       sales for the last five years. We do not depend on any single customer or small       group of customers to the extent that the loss of such customer or group of       customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.  In       addition to producing and selling cars and trucks, we also provide retail       customers with a wide range of after-the-sale vehicle services and products       through our dealer network, in areas such as maintenance and light repair,       heavy       repair, collision, vehicle accessories and extended service warranty. In North       America, we market these products and services under several brands, including       Genuine Ford and Lincoln-Mercury Parts and ServiceSM,       Ford       Extended Service PlanSM,       and       MotorcraftSM.  The       worldwide automotive industry, Ford included, is affected significantly by       general economic conditions (among other factors) over which we have little       control. This is especially so because vehicles are durable goods, which provide       consumers latitude in determining whether and when to replace an existing       vehicle. The decision whether and when to make a vehicle purchase may be       affected significantly by slowing economic growth, geo-political events and       other factors (including the cost of purchasing and operating cars and trucks       and the availability and cost of credit and fuel). Accordingly, the number       of       cars and trucks sold (commonly referred to as "industry demand") may vary       substantially from year to year. The automotive industry is also a highly       competitive, cyclical business that has a wide and growing variety of product       offerings from a growing number of increasingly global manufacturers.   Our       unit       sales vary with the level of total industry demand and our share of that       industry demand. In the short term, our unit sales also are influenced by the       level of dealer inventory. Our share is influenced by how our products are       perceived in comparison to those offered by other manufacturers based on many       factors, including price, quality, styling, reliability, safety, and       functionality. Our share also can be affected by the timing and frequency of       new       model introductions. Our ability to satisfy changing consumer preferences with       respect to type or size of vehicle, as well as design and performance       characteristics, can impact our sales and earnings significantly.  The       profitability of vehicle sales is affected by many factors, including the       following:  • unit       sales volume;   • the       mix       of vehicles and options sold;   • the       margin of profit on each vehicle sold;   • the       level       of "incentives" (e.g., price discounts) and other marketing costs;  • the       costs       for customer warranty claims and additional service actions; and  • the       costs       for safety, emission and fuel economy technology and equipment.  Further,       because Ford and other manufacturers have a high proportion of costs that are       relatively fixed (including labor costs), small changes in unit sales volumes       can significantly affect overall profitability.  In       addition, the automobile industry continues to face a very competitive pricing       environment, driven in part by industry excess capacity. For the past several       decades, manufacturers typically have given price discounts and other marketing       incentives to purchasers to maintain their market shares and production levels.       A discussion of our strategies to compete in this pricing environment is set       forth below in "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial       Condition and Results of Operations - Overview."  Competitive       Position.       The       worldwide automotive industry consists of many producers, with no single       dominant producer. Certain manufacturers, however, account for the major       percentage of total sales within particular countries, especially their       countries of origin. Detailed information regarding our competitive position       in       the principal markets where we compete can be found below as part of the overall       discussion of the automotive industry in those markets.         3        ITEM             1. Business (continued)       Seasonality.       We       generally record the sale of a vehicle (and recognize sales proceeds in revenue)       when it is produced and shipped to our customer (i.e., our dealer or       distributor). We manage our vehicle production schedule based on a number of       factors, including dealer stock levels (i.e., the number of units held in       inventory by our dealers and distributors for sale to retail and fleet       customers) and retail sales (i.e., units sold by our dealers and distributors       to       their customers at retail). We experience some fluctuation in the business       of a       seasonal nature. Generally, North American production is higher in the first       half of the year to meet demand in the spring and summer, which are usually       the       strongest sales months of the year. Third quarter production is typically the       lowest of the year, owing to the annual two-week vacation shutdown of our       manufacturing facilities during this quarter. As a result, operating results       for       the third quarter typically are less favorable than those of the other quarters.         Raw       Materials.       We       purchase a wide variety of raw materials for use in the production of our       vehicles from numerous suppliers around the world. These raw materials include       non-ferrous metals (e.g., aluminum), precious metals (e.g., palladium), ferrous       metals (e.g., steel and iron castings), energy (e.g., natural gas) and resins       (e.g., polypropylene). We believe that we have adequate supplies or sources       of       availability of the raw materials necessary to meet our needs. However, there       are risks and uncertainties with respect to the supply of certain of these       raw       materials that could impact their availability in sufficient quantities to       meet       our needs. See "Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of       Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview" for a discussion       of       commodity price trends, and "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures       About Market Risk - Commodity Price Risk" for a discussion of commodity price       risks.  Backlog       Orders.       We       generally produce and ship our products on average within approximately 20       days       after an order is deemed to become firm. Therefore, no significant amount of       backlog orders accumulates during any period.  Intellectual       Property.       We own       or hold licenses to use numerous patents, copyrights and trademarks on a global       basis. Our policy is to protect our competitive position by, among other       methods, filing U.S. and international patent applications to protect technology       and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business.       As such, we have generated a large number of patents related to the operation       of       our business and expect this portfolio to continue to grow as we actively pursue       additional technological innovation. We currently have approximately 12,000       active patents and pending patent applications globally, with an average age       for       patents in our active patent portfolio being just over 5 years. In addition       to       this intellectual property, we also rely on our proprietary knowledge and       ongoing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive       position. While we believe these patents, patent applications and know-how,       in       the aggregate, to be important to the conduct of our business, and we obtain       licenses to use certain intellectual property owned by others, none is       individually considered material to our business. We also own numerous       trademarks and service marks that contribute to the identity and recognition       of       our company and its products and services globally. Certain of these marks       are       integral to the conduct of our business, and the loss of any of these could       have       a material adverse effect on our business.   Warranty       Coverage and Additional Service Actions.       Ford       Motor Company or Ford Motor Vehicle Assurance Company, a subsidiary of Ford       Motor Company, presently provides warranties on all vehicles sold by Ford Motor       Company. Warranties are offered for specific periods of time and/or mileage,       and       vary depending upon the type of product, usage of the product and the geographic       location of its sale. The       types       of warranty coverage offered include base coverage       (e.g., "bumper-to-bumper" coverage in the United States on Ford brand vehicles       for 36 months or 36,000 miles, whichever occurs first), safety restraint       coverage, and corrosion coverage. In compliance with regulatory requirements,       we       also provide emissions       defects and emissions performance warranty coverage. Pursuant to these       warranties, Ford Motor Company will repair, replace, or adjust all parts on       a       vehicle that are defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship during       the specified warranty period.   In       addition to the costs associated with the contractual warranty coverage provided       on our vehicles, we also incur costs as a result of additional service actions       not covered by our warranties, including product recalls and customer       satisfaction actions.   Estimated       warranty and additional service action costs for each vehicle sold by us are       accrued for at the time of sale. Accruals for estimated warranty and additional       service action costs are based on historical experience and subject to       adjustment from time to time depending on actual experience. Warranty accrual       adjustments required when actual warranty claim experience differs from our       estimates may have a material impact on our financial condition.   For       additional information with respect to costs for warranty and additional service       actions, see "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial       Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates" and Note       27       of the Notes to the Financial Statements.           4        ITEM             1. Business (continued)       United       States   Sales       Data.       The       following table shows U.S. industry sales of cars and trucks for the years       indicated:              U.S.                   Industry Sales             Years                   Ended December 31,             2005     2004     2003     2002     2001           (millions                   of units)       Cars       7.7       7.5       7.6       8.1       8.4       Trucks       9.8       9.8       9.4       9.0       9.1       Total       17.5       17.3       17.0       17.1       17.5        We       classify cars by small, medium, large and premium segments, and trucks by       compact pickup, bus/van (including minivans), full-size pickup, sport utility       vehicles and medium/heavy segments. However, with the introduction of crossover       vehicles, the distinction between traditional cars and trucks has become more       difficult to draw, and these vehicles are not consistently classified as either       cars or trucks across vehicle manufacturers. In the tables above and below,       we       have classified crossover vehicles as sport utility vehicles. In addition,       we       have classified as "premium" all of our luxury cars, regardless of size; premium       sport utility vehicles and crossovers are included in "trucks." Annually, we       conduct a comprehensive review of many factors to determine the appropriate       classification of vehicle segments and the vehicles within those segments,       and       this review occasionally results in a change of classification for certain       vehicles.   The       following tables show the proportion of U.S. car and truck unit sales by segment       for the industry (including both domestic and foreign-based manufacturers)       and       Ford (including all of our brands sold in the United States) for the years       indicated:            U.S.                   Industry Vehicle Mix of Sales by                   Segment           Years                   Ended December 31,           2005     2004     2003     2002     2001       CARS                                     Small       16.7   %     15.9   %     16.4   %     17.3   %     18.4   %     Medium       12.6       13.6       14.8       15.6       15.8       Large       7.0       6.3       6.1       6.9       7.1       Premium       7.7       7.6       7.6       7.5       6.9       Total                   U.S. Industry Car Sales       44.0       43.4       44.9       47.3       48.2       TRUCKS                                     Compact                   Pickup       3.9   %     4.0   %     4.4   %     4.7   %     5.1   %     Bus/Van       8.2       8.2       8.0       8.6       8.7       Full-Size                   Pickup       14.5       14.6       14.0       13.1       13.4       Sport                   Utility Vehicles       26.7       27.6       27.0       24.9       23.0       Medium/Heavy       2.7       2.2       1.7       1.4       1.6       Total                   U.S. Industry Truck Sales       56.0       56.6       55.1       52.7       51.8       Total                   U.S. Industry Vehicle Sales       100.0   %     100.0   %     100.0   %     100.0   %     100.0   %                    Ford                 Vehicle Mix of Sales by                 Segment in U.S.             Years                 Ended December 31,             2005     2004     2003     2002     2001       CARS                                     Small       10.9   %     10.2   %     11.4   %     12.5   %     14.0   %     Medium       7.7       8.8       10.4       11.9       11.5       Large       8.3       5.0       4.8       4.4       5.2       Premium       5.9       6.6       7.0       7.8       7.0       Total                 Ford U.S. Car Sales       32.8       30.6       33.6       36.6       37.7       TRUCKS                                     Compact                 Pickup       3.8   %     4.7   %     6.0   %     6.2   %     6.9   %     Bus/Van       8.4       8.8       8.4       9.1       9.1       Full-Size                 Pickup       28.4       28.2       24.3       22.5       22.9       Sport                 Utility Vehicles       26.1       27.4       27.5       25.4       23.2       Medium/Heavy       0.5       0.3       0.2       0.2       0.2       Total                 Ford U.S. Truck Sales       67.2       69.4       66.4       63.4       62.3       Total                 Ford U.S. Vehicle Sales       100.0   %     100.0   %     100.0   %     100.0   %     100.0   %              5        ITEM             1. Business (continued)       As       the       tables above indicate, there has been a general shift from cars to trucks for       both industry sales and Ford sales; 2005 is the first year in recent years       in       which segmentation shifted back toward cars. Prior to 2005, both industry and       Ford's truck mix had been increasing since 2001, reflecting higher sales of       sport utility vehicles and full-size pickups. In 2005, in line with industry       trends, Ford's sport utility vehicle sales as a percent of total sales declined,       while large and small car percentages increased. The increase in 2005 in the       proportion of large cars sold by Ford largely reflects the introduction of       new       models in this segment (e.g., Ford Five Hundred and Mercury       Montego).  Market       Share Data.       Our       principal competitors in the United States include General Motors Corporation,       DaimlerChrysler Corporation, Toyota Motor Corporation, Honda Motor Company       and       Nissan Motor Company. The following tables show changes in U.S. car and truck       market share for Ford (including all of our brands sold in the U.S.), and for       the other five leading vehicle manufacturers for the years indicated. The       percentages in each of the following tables represent the percentage of the       combined car and truck industry:            U.S.                 Car Market Shares*             Years                 Ended December 31,             2005     2004     2003     2002     2001       Ford       6.0   %     5.9   %     6.9   %     7.7   %     8.6   %     General                 Motors       10.0       10.9       11.5       12.1       13.0       DaimlerChrysler       4.0       3.8       3.8       4.1       4.1       Toyota       7.4       6.4       5.9       5.8       5.5       Honda       4.8       4.9       4.8       4.9       5.1       Nissan       3.3       3.1       3.0       2.5       2.4       All                 Other**       8.5       8.4       9.0       10.2       9.5       Total                 U.S. Car Retail Deliveries       44.0   %     43.4   %     44.9   %     47.3   %     48.2   %             __________  * All       U.S.       retail sales data are based on publicly available information from the media       and       trade publications.  ** "All       Other" includes primarily companies based in Korea, other Japanese manufacturers       and various European manufacturers, and, with respect to the U.S. Truck Market       Shares table and U.S. Combined Car and Truck Market Shares table, includes       heavy       truck manufacturers.  The       decline in overall market share for Ford since 2001 is primarily the result       of       several factors, including increased competition, a recent shift away from       our       stronger segments (e.g., traditional sport utility vehicles) and the       discontinuation of a number of vehicles such as Ford Escort, Ford Explorer       Sport, Mercury Cougar, Mercury Villager and Lincoln Continental.         6        ITEM             1. Business (continued)      Fleet       Sales.       The       sales data and market share information provided above include both retail       and       fleet sales. Fleet sales include sales to daily rental car companies, commercial       fleet customers, leasing companies and governments.   The       table       below shows our fleet sales (including all brands) in the United States, and       the       amount of those sales as a percentage of our total U.S. car and truck sales       for       the last five years:      Total       fleet sales increased in 2004 and 2005, reflecting a stronger fleet industry.       Similarly, increased daily rental unit sales in 2005 compared with 2004       primarily reflected strong segment demand.   Europe  Market       Share Information.       Outside       of the United States, Europe is our largest market for the sale of cars and       trucks. We consider Europe to consist of the following 19 markets: Britain,       Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Netherlands, Portugal,       Switzerland, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary       and Poland. The automotive industry in Europe is intensely competitive. Our       principal competitors in Europe include General Motors Corporation, Volkswagen       A.G. Group, PSA Group, Renault Group and Fiat SpA. For the past 10 years, the       top six manufacturers have collectively held between 69% and 74% of the total       car market. This competitive environment is expected to intensify further as       Japanese and Korean manufacturers increase their production capacity in Europe,       and all of the other (non-Ford) manufacturers of premium brands (e.g., BMW,       Mercedes Benz and Audi) continue to broaden their product offerings.   For       this       discussion, 2005 market data are based on estimated registrations currently       available; percentage change is measured from actual 2004 registrations. In       2005, vehicle manufacturers sold approximately 17.5 million cars and trucks       in       Europe, down 0.1% from 2004 levels. Our combined car and truck market share       in       Europe (including all of our brands sold in Europe) in 2005 was 10.8% (down       0.1       percentage points from 2004).   Britain       and Germany are our most important markets within Europe. Any adverse change       in       the British or German market has a significant effect on our total European       automotive profits. For 2005 compared with 2004, total industry sales were       down       4.4% in Britain and up 1.7% in Germany. Our combined car and truck market share       in these markets (including all of our brands sold in these markets) in 2005       was       19.5% in Britain (down 0.2 percentage points from the previous year), and 8.6%       in Germany (down 0.2 percentage points from the previous       year).  Although       not included in the primary 19 markets above, several additional markets in       the       region contribute to our Ford Europe business unit results. Ford's share of       the Turkish market increased by 1.5 percentage points to 17.0% - the fourth       year       in a row that the Ford brand has led the market in sales in Turkey. We also       are experiencing strong sales in Russia, where sales of Ford-brand vehicles       increased approximately 54% to 60,500 units in 2005.  Motor       Vehicle Distribution in Europe.       On       October 1, 2002, the Commission of the European Union ("Commission") adopted       a       new regulation that changed the way motor vehicles are sold and repaired       throughout the European Community (the "Block Exemption Regulation"). Under       the       Block Exemption Regulation, manufacturers had the choice to either operate       an       "exclusive" distribution system with exclusive dealer sales territories, but       with the possibility of sales to any reseller (e.g., supermarket chains,       internet agencies and other resellers not authorized by the manufacturer),       who       in turn could sell to end customers both within and outside of the dealer’s       exclusive sales territory, or a "selective" distribution system.  We,       as       well as the vast majority of the other automotive manufacturers, have elected       to       establish a "selective" distribution system, allowing us to restrict the       dealer’s ability to sell our vehicles to unauthorized resellers. In addition,       under the "selective" distribution system, we are entitled to determine the       number of our dealers but, since October 2005, not their location. Under either       system, the new rules make it easier for a dealer to display and sell multiple       brands in one store without the need to maintain separate       facilities.         7        ITEM             1. Business (continued)       Within       this new regulation, the Commission also has adopted sweeping changes to the       repair industry. Dealers can no longer be required by the manufacturer to       perform repair work themselves. Instead, dealers may subcontract the work to       independent repair shops that meet reasonable criteria set by the manufacturer.       These authorized repair facilities may perform warranty and recall work, in       addition to other repair and maintenance work. While a manufacturer may continue       to require the use of its parts in warranty and recall work, the repair facility       may use parts made by others that are of comparable quality for all other repair       work. We have negotiated and implemented new Dealer, Authorized Repairer and       Spare Part Supply contracts on a country-by-country level and, therefore, the       Block Exemption Regulation now applies with respect to all of our       dealers.  With       these new rules, the Commission intends to increase competition and narrow       car       price differences from country to country. While it remains difficult to       quantify the full impact of these changes on our European operations, the Block       Exemption Regulation continued to contribute to an increasingly competitive       market for vehicles and parts. This has contributed to an increase in marketing       expenses, thus negatively affecting the profitability of our Ford Europe and       PAG       segment. We anticipate that this trend may continue as dealers and parts       suppliers become increasingly organized and established.  Other       Markets  Canada       and Mexico.       Canada       and Mexico also are important markets for us. In Canada, industry sales of       new       cars and trucks in 2005 were approximately 1.63 million units, up 3.5% from       2004       levels. In 2005, industry sales of new cars and trucks in Mexico were       approximately 1.16 million units, up 3.8% from 2004. Our combined car and truck       market share (including all of our brands sold in these markets) in 2005 was       13.9% in Canada (down 0.6 percentage points from the previous year), and 17.2%       in Mexico (up 0.7 percentage points from the previous year).   South       America.       Brazil       and Argentina are our principal markets in South America. The economic       environment in these countries has been volatile in recent years, particularly       in 2002 and 2003, leading to large variations in industry sales. The 2004 and       2005 results have been favorably influenced by continued improvements in       economic conditions, political stability and government actions to reduce       inflation and public deficits. Industry sales in 2005 were approximately       1.7 million units in Brazil, up about 8.6% from 2004, and approximately       377,000 units in Argentina, up about 32.6% from 2004. Our combined car and       truck       share in these markets (including all of our brands sold in these markets)       in       2005 was 12.5% in Brazil (up 0.6 percentage points from the previous year)       and 15.5% in Argentina (down 2.7 percentage points from the previous       year).  Asia       Pacific.       Australia, Taiwan, Thailand, South Africa and Japan are our principal markets       in       this region. Details of preliminary 2005 and actual 2004 industry volumes and       our combined car and truck market share for these countries (including all       of       our brands sold in a particular country) are shown in the table below:               Industry                 Volumes (in                 thousands)       Corporate                 Market Share                     2005         2004     2005 Over/(Under) 2004         2005         2004     2005 Over/(Under) 2004       Australia       988       955       33       3   %     13.8   %     14.9   %     (1.1)                 pts.

We       have       an ownership interest in Mazda Motor Corporation ("Mazda") of approximately       33.4%, and account for Mazda on an equity basis.  Mazda’s market share       in the Asia Pacific region was 3.4% in 2005. Our principal competition in       the Asia Pacific region has been the Japanese manufacturers. We anticipate       that       the ongoing relaxation of import restrictions (including duty reductions) will       continue to intensify competition in the region.  We       began       operations in India in 1999, launching an all-new small car (the Ikon) designed       specifically for that market. In 2003, we launched the Endeavor, Ford’s first       SUV in India, and we also launched the Fusion in late 2004 and the Fiesta in       late 2005. Our operations in India also sell components to other Ford       affiliates.         8        ITEM             1. Business (continued)       We       also       are in the process of increasing our presence in China. Changan Ford Automobile       Corporation, Ltd.       ("Changan       Ford") is our 50/50 joint venture operation with Chongqing Changan Automobile       Co., Ltd. The Changan Ford assembly plant, located in Chongqing, became       operational and began producing the Fiesta model in January 2003, and the Mondeo       model later that year. The Focus model was launched in 2005. We also announced       in 2003 that more than $1 billion would be invested over the next several years       to expand manufacturing capacity, introduce new products and expand distribution       channels in the Chinese automotive market. This investment will initially       support the addition of new products and expansion of production capacity at       Changan Ford in Chongqing from 50,000 units per year to about 200,000 units       per       year. It will also support the establishment of a second assembly plant and       a       new engine plant to be located in Nanjing. We began construction of these new       facilities in 2005, with expected completion in 2007. Initial capacity at the       new assembly facility is expected to be about 160,000 units annually. In       addition, we have a 30% interest in Jiangling Motors Corporation Ltd., which       has       operations in Nanchang and assembles vehicles for distribution in China. We       also       import Jaguar, Volvo, Land Rover, and select Ford vehicles into China. We       continue to operate a purchasing office in China to take advantage of sourcing       opportunities for global markets from that country.

FINANCIAL       SERVICES SECTOR  Ford       Motor Credit Company  Ford       Motor Credit Company ("Ford Credit") offers a wide variety of automotive       financing products to and through automotive dealers throughout the world.       The       predominant share of Ford Credit’s business consists of financing our vehicles       and supporting our dealers. Ford Credit’s primary financial products fall into       the following three categories:  • Retail       financing.       Purchasing retail installment sales contracts and retail lease contracts from       dealers, and offering financing to commercial customers, primarily vehicle       leasing         companies and fleet purchasers, to purchase or lease vehicle       fleets;  • Wholesale       financing.       Making       loans to dealers to finance the purchase of vehicle inventory, also known as       floorplan financing; and  • Other       financing.       Making       loans to dealers for working capital, improvements to dealership facilities,       and       the acquisition and refinancing of dealership real estate.  Ford       Credit also services the finance receivables and leases that it originates       and       purchases, makes loans to our affiliates, purchases certain receivables from       us       and our subsidiaries, and provides insurance services related to its financing       programs. Ford Credit’s revenues are earned primarily from payments made under       retail installment sale contracts and retail leases (including interest       supplements and other support payments it receives from us on special-rate       retail financing programs), from investment and other income related to sold       receivables, and from payments made under wholesale and other dealer loan       financing programs.  Ford       Credit does business in all 50 states of the United States through about 81       dealer automotive financing branches and seven regional service centers, and       does business in all provinces in Canada through seven dealer automotive       financing branches and two regional service centers. Outside of the United       States, FCE Bank plc ("FCE") is Ford Credit’s largest operation. FCE’s primary       business is to support the sale of our vehicles in Europe through our dealer       network. FCE offers a variety of retail, leasing and wholesale finance plans       in       most countries in which it operates; FCE does business in the United Kingdom,       Germany and most other European countries. Ford Credit, through its       subsidiaries, also operates in the Asia Pacific and Latin American regions.       In       addition, FCE, through its Worldwide Trade Financing division, provides       financing to dealers in countries where typically we have no established local       presence.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial       Condition and Results of Operations." For a discussion of how Ford Credit       manages its financial market risks, see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative       Disclosures about Market Risk."  We       sponsor special-rate financing programs available only through Ford Credit.       Under these programs, we make interest-supplement or other support payments       to       Ford Credit. These programs increase Ford Credit’s financing volume and share of       financing sales of our vehicles. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial       Statements for more information about these support payments.  Under       a       profit maintenance agreement with Ford Credit, we have agreed to make payments       to maintain Ford Credit’s earnings at certain levels. In addition, under a       support agreement with FCE, Ford Credit has agreed to maintain FCE’s net worth       above a minimum level. No payments were made under either of these agreements       during the 2003 through 2005 periods.   GOVERNMENTAL       STANDARDS   A       number       of governmental standards and regulations relating to safety, fuel economy,       emissions control, noise control, vehicle recycling, substances of concern,       damageability, and theft prevention are applicable to new motor vehicles,       engines, and equipment manufactured for sale in the United States, Europe and       elsewhere. In addition, manufacturing and assembly facilities in the United       States, Europe and elsewhere are subject to stringent standards regulating       air       emissions, water discharges, and the handling and disposal of hazardous       substances. Such facilities also may be subject to comprehensive national,       regional, and/or local permit programs with respect to such       matters.  Mobile       Source Emissions Control  U.S.       Requirements.       The       federal Clean Air Act imposes stringent limits on the amount of regulated       pollutants that lawfully may be emitted by new motor vehicles and engines       produced for sale in the United States. In 1999, the United States Environmental       Protection Agency ("EPA") promulgated post-2004 model year standards that were       more stringent than the default standards contained in the Clean Air Act. These       regulations require light-duty trucks and certain heavy-duty passenger-carrying       trucks to meet the same emissions standards as passenger cars by the 2007 model       year, and extend emissions durability requirements to 120,000 or 150,000 miles       (depending on the specific standards to which the vehicle is certified). The       stringency of these standards presents compliance challenges and is likely       to       hinder efforts to employ light-duty diesel technology, which could negatively       impact our ability to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy ("CAFE") standards.       The EPA also promulgated post-2004 emissions standards for "heavy-duty" trucks       (8,500-14,000 lbs. gross vehicle weight), which are also likely to pose       technological challenges.  As       discussed in "Stationary Source Emissions Control" below, the EPA continues       to       revise the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter and       ozone, and to redesignate areas of the country from "attainment" to       "non-attainment" status. These changes will further increase pressure to reduce       vehicle emissions of particulate matter, volatile organic compounds and nitrogen       oxide.  Pursuant       to the Clean Air Act, California has received a waiver from the EPA to establish       its own unique emissions control standards. New vehicles and engines sold in       California must be certified by the California Air Resources Board ("CARB").       CARB has adopted stringent vehicle emissions standards that began phasing in       with the 2004 model year. These new standards treat most light-duty trucks       the       same as passenger cars, and require both types of vehicles to meet new stringent       emissions requirements. As with the EPA’s post-2004 standards, CARB’s vehicle       standards present a difficult engineering challenge, and will essentially rule       out the use of light-duty diesel technology. In 2004, CARB voted to adopt       standards limiting emissions of "greenhouse" gases (e.g., carbon dioxide) from       new motor vehicles. Although CARB claims that its vehicle emissions regulations       provide authority for it to          10        ITEM             1. Business (continued)      adopt       such regulations, the EPA has determined that greenhouse gases are not subject       to regulation under the federal Clean Air Act. Since greenhouse gas standards       are functionally equivalent to fuel economy standards, this issue is discussed       more fully in the "Motor Vehicle Fuel Economy" section below.   Since       1990, the California program has included requirements for manufacturers to       produce and deliver for sale zero-emission vehicles ("ZEVs"), which produce       no       emission of regulated pollutants (typically battery-powered vehicles, which       have       had narrow consumer appeal due to their limited range, reduced functionality,       and high cost). This ZEV mandate initially required that a specified percentage       of each manufacturer’s vehicles produced for sale in California be ZEVs,       beginning at 2% in 1998 and increasing to 10% in 2003. In 1996, CARB eliminated       the ZEV mandate for the 1998-2002 model years, but retained the 10% mandate       in a       modified form beginning with the 2003 model year.  In       April       2003, CARB adopted amendments to the ZEV mandate that shifted the near-term       focus of the regulation away from battery-electric vehicles to       advanced-technology vehicles (e.g., hybrid electric vehicles or natural gas       vehicles) with extremely low tailpipe emissions. The rules also give some credit       for so-called "partial zero-emission vehicles" ("PZEVs"), which can be internal       combustion engine vehicles certified to very low tailpipe emissions and zero       evaporative emissions. In addition, the rules call on the auto industry to       ramp       up production of zero-emission fuel cell vehicles over the longer term. In       the       aggregate, the industry must produce 250 zero-emission fuel cell vehicles by       the       2008 model year, and 2,500 more in the 2009-2011 model year period. A panel       of       independent experts will review the feasibility of these requirements in 2006.       While the changes appear to reflect a recognition that battery-electric vehicles       simply do not have the potential to achieve widespread consumer acceptance,       there are substantial questions about the feasibility of producing the required       number of zero-emission fuel-cell vehicles due to the substantial engineering       challenges and high costs associated with this technology. It is doubtful       whether the market will support the number of required ZEVs, even taking into       account the recent modifications of the ZEV mandate. Fuel cell technology in       the       future may enable production of ZEVs with widespread consumer appeal. However,       due to the engineering challenges, the high cost of the technology,       infrastructure needs, and other issues, it does not appear that mass production       of fuel cell vehicles will be commercially feasible for years to come.       Compliance with the ZEV mandate may eventually require costly actions that       would       have a substantial adverse effect on Ford’s sales volume and profits. For       example, Ford could be required to curtail the sale of non-ZEVs and/or offer       to       sell ZEVs, advanced-technology vehicles, and PZEVs well below cost.  The       Clean       Air Act permits other states that do not meet national ambient air quality       standards to adopt California’s motor vehicle emissions standards no later than       two years before the affected model year. In addition to California, nine       states, primarily located in the Northeast and Northwest, have adopted the       California standards (including California's greenhouse gas provisions). Eight       of these states also adopted the ZEV requirements. These nine states, together       with California, account for approximately 25% of Ford's current light-duty       vehicle sales volume in the United States. More states are considering adopting       the California standards. Unfortunately, there are problems inherent in       transferring California standards to other states, including the following:       1)       managing fleet average emissions standards and ZEV mandate requirements on       a       state-by-state basis presents a major challenge to automobile company       distribution systems; 2) the driving range of many ZEVs is greatly diminished       in       cold weather, thereby limiting their market appeal; and 3) the states adopting       the California program have refused thus far to adopt the California       reformulated gasoline regulations, which may impair the ability of vehicles       to       meet California’s in-use standards.  Under       the       Clean Air Act, the EPA and CARB may require manufacturers to recall and repair       non-conforming vehicles (which may be identified by testing or analysis done       by       the manufacturer, the EPA or CARB), or we may voluntarily stop shipment of       or       recall non-conforming vehicles. The costs of related repairs or inspections       associated with such recalls, or a stop shipment order, could be       substantial.  Both       CARB       and the EPA also have adopted on-board diagnostic ("OBD") regulations, which       require a vehicle to monitor its emissions control system and notify the vehicle       operator (via the "check engine" light) of any malfunction. These regulations       have become extremely complicated, and creation of a compliant system requires       substantial engineering resources. In 2005, CARB adopted even more stringent       OBD       requirements for heavy-duty vehicles, and has initiated rulemaking to further       regulate light-duty vehicle OBD systems. Many states have implemented OBD tests       as part of their inspection and maintenance program. Failure of in-service       compliance tests could lead to vehicle recalls with substantial costs for       related inspections or repairs.   European       Requirements.       European       Union ("EU") directives and related legislation limit the amount of regulated       pollutants that may be emitted by new motor vehicles and engines sold in the       EU.       In 1998, the EU adopted a new directive on emissions from passenger cars and       light commercial trucks. More stringent emissions standards applied to new       car       certifications beginning January 1, 2000 and to new car registrations       beginning January 1, 2001 ("Stage III Standards"). A second level of even more       stringent emissions standards were applied to new car certifications beginning       January 1, 2005 and to new car registrations beginning          11        ITEM             1. Business (continued)      January 1, 2006       ("Stage IV Standards"). The comparable light commercial truck Stage III       Standards and Stage IV Standards come into effect one year later than the       passenger car requirements. This directive on emissions also introduced OBD       requirements, more stringent evaporative emissions requirements, and in-service       compliance testing and recall provisions for emissions-related defects that       occur in the first five years or 80,000 kilometers of vehicle life (extended       to       100,000 kilometers in 2005). Failure of in-service compliance tests could lead       to vehicle recalls with substantial costs for related inspections or repairs.       The Stage IV Standards for diesel engines have proven technologically difficult       and precluded manufacturers from offering some products in time to be eligible       for government incentive programs. The EU commenced a program in 2004 to       determine the specifics for further changes to vehicle emissions standards,       and       in 2005 the European Commission published a proposed law for Stage V emissions.       Specific mandated targets/limits are yet to be determined. It is anticipated       that the law will not be finalized before the end of 2006.   Other       National Requirements.       Many       countries, in an effort to address air quality concerns, are adopting previous       versions of European or United Nations Economic Commission for Europe ("UNECE")       mobile source emissions regulations. Some countries have adopted more advanced       regulations based on the most recent version of European or U.S. regulations;       for example, China has adopted the most recent European standards to be       implemented in the 2008-2010 timeframe. Korea and Taiwan have adopted very       stringent U.S.-based standards for gasoline vehicles, and European-based       standards for diesel vehicles. Because fleet average requirements do not apply,       some vehicle emissions control systems may have to be redesigned to meet the       requirements in these markets. Furthermore, not all of these countries have       adopted appropriate fuel quality standards to accompany the stringent emissions       standards adopted. This could lead to problems, particularly if OBD or in-use       surveillance are implemented. Japan has unique standards and test procedures,       and is considering more stringent standards for implementation in 2009. This       may       require unique emissions control systems be designed for the Japanese       market.  Stationary       Source Emissions Control  In       the       United States, the federal Clean Air Act also requires the EPA to identify       "hazardous air pollutants" from various industries and promulgate rules       restricting their emission. The EPA has issued final rules for a variety of       industrial categories, several of which would further regulate emissions from       our U.S. operations, including engine testing, automobile surface coating and       iron casting. These technology-based standards require certain of our facilities       to significantly reduce their air emissions. Additional programs under the       Clean       Air Act, including Compliance Assurance Monitoring and periodic monitoring       could       require our facilities to install additional emission monitoring equipment.       The       cost to us, in the aggregate, to comply with these requirements could be       substantial.  The       Clean       Air Act also requires the EPA to periodically review and update its National       Ambient Air Quality Standards, and to designate whether counties or other local       areas are in compliance with the new standards. If an area or county does not       meet the new standards ("non-attainment areas"), the state must revise its       implementation plans to achieve attainment. The EPA recently established new       designations that reclassify many of the areas where Ford's manufacturing       facilities are located as non-attainment areas. It is likely that the affected       states will revise their implementation plans to require additional emission       control equipment and impose more stringent permit requirements on these       facilities. The cost to us, in the aggregate, to comply with these requirements       could be substantial.   Motor       Vehicle Safety   U.S.       Requirements.       The       National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the "Safety Act")       regulates motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment in the United States in       two       primary ways. First, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States       of       any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable motor vehicle       safety standards established by the National Highway Traffic Safety       Administration ("NHTSA"). Meeting or exceeding many safety standards is costly,       because the standards tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight       in       order to meet emissions and fuel economy standards. Second, the Safety Act       requires that defects related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety       recall campaigns. A manufacturer also is obligated to recall vehicles if it       determines that the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard. Should Ford       or NHTSA determine that either a safety defect or a noncompliance exists with       respect to certain of Ford’s vehicles, the costs of such recall campaigns could       be substantial. There were pending before NHTSA eight investigations relating       to       alleged safety defects or potential compliance issues in Ford vehicles as of       January 17, 2006.   The       Safe,       Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for       Users ("SAFETEA-LU") was also signed into law in 2005. SAFETEA-LU establishes       a       number of substantive, safety-related rulemaking mandates for NHTSA that can       be       expected to result in new regulations and product content requirements.   The       Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act (the       "TREAD Act") was signed into law in November 2000. The TREAD Act required NHTSA       to establish several new regulations, including reporting requirements for       motor          12        ITEM             1. Business (continued)      vehicle       manufacturers on foreign recalls and certain information received by the       manufacturer that may assist the agency in the early identification of safety       defects. As part of its rulemaking efforts, NHTSA defined certain types of       material provided by manufacturers as competitively sensitive and entitled       to a       presumption of confidentiality, including warranty claim information, field       reports, and consumer complaint information. Public Citizen, an advocacy       organization, has filed a lawsuit challenging NHTSA’s confidentiality       determinations, which may be resolved in the 2006 calendar year. If Public       Citizen prevails, Ford and other manufacturers may lose the ability to protect       warranty and consumer information after it is submitted to NHTSA pursuant to       the       TREAD Act.  Foreign       Requirements.       Canada,       the EU, individual member countries within the EU, and other countries in       Europe, South America and the Asia Pacific markets also have safety standards       applicable to motor vehicles and are likely to adopt additional or more       stringent standards in the future. In addition, the European Automobile       Manufacturers Association ("EAMA") (also known in Europe as the "ACEA"), of       which Ford is a member, made a voluntary commitment in June 2001 to introduce       a       range of safety measures to improve pedestrian protection with the first phase       starting in 2005 and a second phase starting in 2010. Similar commitments were       subsequently made by the Japanese and Korean automobile manufacturers       associations. As a result, over 99% of cars and small vans sold in Europe are       covered by industry safety commitments. The European Council of Ministers and       the European Parliament published a directive in December 2003 and a decision       in       February 2004, which together set forth detailed technical provisions for       enforcement of the industry commitments (i.e., the application dates, the types       of tests to be conducted, the test procedures to be used and the limit values       to       be achieved).  Motor       Vehicle Fuel Economy  U.S.       Requirements.       Under       federal law, vehicles must meet minimum corporate average fuel economy standards       set by NHTSA. A manufacturer is subject to potentially substantial civil       penalties if it fails to meet the CAFE standard in any model year, after taking       into account all available credits for the preceding three model years and       expected credits for the three succeeding model years.  Federal       law established a passenger car CAFE standard of 27.5 miles per gallon for       1985       and later model years, which NHTSA believes it has the authority to amend to       a       level it determines to be the maximum feasible level. By rule, NHTSA has set       light-truck CAFE standards of 21.6 miles per gallon for model year 2006, and       of       22.2 miles per gallon for model year 2007. In August 2005, NHTSA issued a Notice       of Proposed Rulemaking regarding light-truck fuel economy standards for the       2008-2011 model years. The proposed rules set forth a new structure for       light-truck fuel economy standards. Under the proposal, each manufacturer would       be required, by the 2011 model year, to apply a series of size-based category       targets to its particular mix of light-trucks in order to calculate the       light-truck fuel economy standards applicable to that manufacturer. In model       years 2008-2010, manufacturers would have the option of complying with       traditional light-truck standards set by NHTSA, or opting into the new       structure.   The       Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, Ford, and other automotive companies       have       submitted extensive comments on the proposed rules. In general, Ford favors       the       new structure proposed by NHTSA, but until the final rule is established the       effect of NHTSA's proposal on Ford's ability to comply with light-truck CAFE       requirements remains unclear. NHTSA is expected to issue a final rule in April       2006. There are indications that NHTSA may begin work on a new rule to raise       car       CAFE standards once the light-truck rule is finalized. In addition, a number       of       CAFE-related bills have been introduced in Congress, where there is always       the       possibility that new legislation could vitiate the existing regulatory process       and establish new fuel economy standards by statute.   Pressure       to increase CAFE standards stems in part from concerns about the impact of       carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the global climate. In       1999, a petition was filed with the EPA requesting that it regulate carbon       dioxide emissions from motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act. This would have       the effect of imposing more stringent fuel economy standards, since the amount       of carbon dioxide emitted by a vehicle is directly proportional to the amount       of       fuel consumed. The petitioners later filed suit in an effort to compel a formal       response from the EPA. In August 2003, the EPA denied the petition on the       grounds that the Clean Air Act does not authorize the EPA to regulate greenhouse       gas emissions, and only NHTSA is authorized to regulate fuel economy under       the       CAFE law. A number of states, cities, and environmental groups filed for review       of the EPA’s decision in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of       Columbia. A coalition of states and industry trade groups, including the       Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers (an industry trade group made up of nine       leading automotive manufacturers including BMW, DaimlerChrysler, Ford, General       Motors and Toyota (the "Alliance")) intervened in support of the EPA’s decision.       In July 2005, the Court held that the EPA had exercised reasonable discretion       in       determining not to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant. The petitioners       are       seeking review of this holding by the United States Supreme Court.  In       September 2004, CARB adopted California greenhouse gas emissions regulations       applicable to 2009-2016 model year cars and trucks, effectively imposing more       stringent fuel economy standards than those set by NHTSA. These regulations       impose standards that are equivalent to a CAFE standard of more than 43 miles       per gallon for passenger cars and small trucks, and approximately          13        ITEM             1. Business (continued)      27 miles       per gallon for large light trucks and medium-duty passenger vehicles by model       year 2016. The Alliance and individual companies (including Ford) submitted       comments opposing the rules and addressing errors in CARB’s underlying economic       and technical analyses. In December 2004, the Alliance filed suit in federal       district court in Fresno, California. The suit challenges the regulation on       several bases, including that it is preempted by the federal CAFE law. That       litigation is now in the discovery phase, and trial is expected in 2007. A       host       of other states have adopted, or are in the process of adopting, CARB's       greenhouse gas standards. These states include New York, Massachusetts, Maine,       Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Oregon, and       Washington. Several other states are known to be considering the adoption of       such rules. As of this writing, the Alliance has filed litigation in the state       courts of New York and Oregon alleging procedural errors associated with these       states' adoption of greenhouse gas rules. The Alliance has also filed suit       in       federal court challenging Vermont's adoption of these rules. Additional cases       are likely to be filed in 2006.  Ford's       ability to comply with CAFE or greenhouse gas emissions standards depends       heavily on the alignment of these standards with actual consumer demand. If       consumers demand vehicles that are relatively large, have high performance,       and/or are feature-laden, while regulatory standards are skewed toward vehicles       that are smaller and more economical, compliance becomes problematic. Moreover,       if regulatory requirements call for rapid, substantial increases in fleet       average fuel economy (or decreases in fleet average greenhouse gas emissions),       the Company may not have adequate resources and time to make major product       changes across most or all of its vehicle fleet. If significant increases in       CAFE standards are imposed beyond those presently in effect or proposed, or       if       state greenhouse gas regulations are not overturned, we may be forced to take       various costly actions that could have substantial adverse effects on our sales       volume and profits. For example, we may have to curtail production of certain       vehicles such as family-size, luxury, and high-performance cars and full-size       light-trucks; restrict offerings of selected engines and popular options; and/or       increase market support programs for our most fuel-efficient cars and       light-trucks in order to maintain compliance.    European       Requirements.       The EU       is a party to the Kyoto Protocol and has agreed to reduce greenhouse gas       emissions by 8% below their 1990 levels during the 2008-2012 period. In December       1997, the European Council of Environment Ministers reaffirmed its goal to       reduce average carbon dioxide emissions from new cars to 120 grams per kilometer       by 2010 (at the latest) and invited European motor vehicle manufacturers to       negotiate further with the European Commission on a satisfactory voluntary       environmental agreement to help achieve this goal. In October 1998, the EU       agreed to support an environmental agreement with ACEA (of which Ford is a       member) on carbon dioxide emission reductions from new passenger cars (the       "ACEA       Agreement"). The ACEA Agreement establishes an emissions target of 140 grams       of       carbon dioxide per kilometer for the average of new cars sold in the EU by       the       ACEA’s members in 2008. Average carbon dioxide emissions of 140 grams per       kilometer for new passenger cars corresponds to a 25% reduction in average       carbon dioxide emissions compared to 1995. To date, the industry has made good       progress, and has met the interim target for 2003 (165 - 170 grams of carbon       dioxide per kilometer); however, achieving the 140 grams per kilometer target       remains ambitious both technologically and economically.   In       2005,       ACEA and the European Commission reviewed the potential for additional carbon       dioxide reductions, with the goal of achieving the EU’s objective of 120 grams       of carbon dioxide per kilometer by 2010. The discussions are advancing the       concept of an integrated approach to further reductions involving the oil       industry and other sectors.  Other       European countries are considering other initiatives for reducing carbon dioxide       emissions from motor vehicles, including fiscal measures. For example, the       U.K.       introduced a vehicle excise duty and company car taxation based on carbon       dioxide emissions in 2001, and other member states such as France and Portugal       have announced their intention to adopt carbon dioxide-based taxes for passenger       cars.  Other       National Requirements.       Some       Asian countries (such as China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan) have also       adopted fuel efficiency targets. For example, Japan has fuel efficiency targets       for 2010 passenger car and commercial trucks with incentives for early adoption.       China has adopted targets for 2005 and 2008, and is expected to continue setting       new targets to address energy security issues.  Following       considerable discussion, the Canadian automobile industry signed a Memorandum       of       Understanding ("MOU") dated April 5, 2005 with the Canadian government in which       the industry voluntarily committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from       the       Canadian vehicle fleet by 5.3 megatons ("Mt") by 2010 (which slightly exceeds       the government's 5.2 Mt target under its Kyoto Protocol Climate Change Action       Plan). The MOU contains the following interim targets for the entire Canadian       automobile industry: 2.4 Mt reduction by 2007, total reduction of 3.0 Mt in       2008, total reduction of 3.9 Mt in 2009 and the full 5.3 Mt reduction in 2010.       Pursuant to the MOU, a committee of industry and government representatives       has       been established to monitor the industry's overall compliance with the annual       MOU targets.          14        ITEM             1. Business (continued)      European       Chemicals Policy  The       European Commission adopted a draft regulation in October 2003 for a single       system to register, evaluate, and authorize the use of certain chemicals       ("REACH"). Final adoption of the regulation is anticipated in the 2006-2007       timeframe, followed by a pre-registration phase of eighteen months.       Implementation of the legislation is likely to be administratively burdensome       for all entities in the supply chain, and research and development ("R&D")       resources may be redirected from "market-driven" to "REACH-driven" R&D. The       regulation also may accelerate the ban or restriction on use of certain       chemicals and materials, which could increase the costs of certain products       and       processes used to manufacture vehicles and parts.  Pollution       Control Costs  During       the period 2006 through 2010, we expect to spend approximately $346 million       on       our North American and European facilities to comply with air and water       pollution and hazardous waste control standards which are now in effect or       are       scheduled to come into effect during this period. Of this total, we estimate       spending approximately $69 million in 2006 and $71 million in 2007. Specific       environmental expenses are difficult to isolate because expenditures may be       made       for more than one purpose, making precise classification difficult.   EMPLOYMENT       DATA   The       approximate number of individuals employed by us and our consolidated entities       (including entities we do not control) at December 31, 2005 and 2004       was as follows (in thousands):             2005     2004*       Business                 Unit                   Automotive                   The                 Americas                   Ford                 North America       140       126       Ford                 South America       13       12       Ford                 Europe and PAG                   Ford                 Europe       66       69       PAG       49       51       Ford                 Asia Pacific and Africa       18       18       Financial                 Services                   Ford                 Motor Credit Company       14       18       The                 Hertz Corporation       -                        31       Total       300       325          * Employment       figures for 2004 have been adjusted to conform to 2005 business unit       presentation.   As       shown       in the employment data above, from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005,       the       number of people we employed decreased approximately eight percent. This       decrease primarily reflects the sale of Hertz, partially offset by the formation       of Automotive Components Holdings, LLC ("ACH") which employs approximately       17,700 Ford hourly workers who were previously assigned to Visteon Corporation       ("Visteon") and approximately 2,500 former Visteon employees. Not included       in       these employment data are approximately 5,000 Visteon salaried workers leased       to       ACH. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition       and Results of Operations - Overview" and Notes 4 and 23 of the Notes to the       Financial Statements for additional discussion relating to the Visteon       transaction and ACH.   Substantially       all of the hourly employees in our Automotive operations in the United States       are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements.       Approximately 99% of these unionized hourly employees in our Automotive segment       are represented by the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and       Agricultural Implement Workers of America ("UAW" or "United Automobile       Workers"). Approximately 2% of our U.S. salaried employees are represented       by       unions. Most hourly employees and many non-management salaried employees of       our       subsidiaries outside of the United States also are represented by       unions.         15        ITEM             1. Business (continued)       Our       average labor cost per-hour-worked for hourly employees of Ford in the United       States, excluding subsidiaries, was as follows for the listed       years:      We       have       entered into collective bargaining agreements with the UAW, and the National       Automobile, Aerospace, Transportation and General Workers Union of Canada ("CAW"       or "Canadian Automobile Workers"). Among other things, our agreements with       the       UAW and CAW provide for guaranteed wage and benefit levels throughout the term       of the respective agreements, and provide for significant employment security.       As a practical matter, these agreements may restrict our ability to eliminate       product lines, close plants, and divest businesses during the terms of the       agreements. Our agreement with the UAW expires on September 14, 2007, and our       agreement with the CAW expires on September 16, 2008. Historically, negotiation       of new collective bargaining agreements with the UAW and CAW have typically       resulted in increases in wages and benefits, including retirement benefits;       some       of these increases typically have been provided to salaried employees as       well.  In       2005,       we negotiated new Ford collective bargaining agreements with labor unions in       Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain,       Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. We also negotiated new collective bargaining       agreements to cover employees at our Aston Martin (Britain), Land Rover       (Britain) and Volvo (Belgium and Sweden) affiliates.  In       2006,       we are or will be negotiating new collective bargaining agreements with labor       unions in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Britain, France, Germany,       Mexico, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. We will also negotiate new       collective bargaining agreements at our Jaguar (Britain) and Volvo (Sweden)       affiliates.  In       recent       years, we have not had significant work stoppages at our facilities or the       facilities of our suppliers. A work stoppage could occur as a result of disputes       under our collective bargaining agreements with labor unions or in connection       with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements, which, if protracted,       could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Work stoppages       at       supplier facilities for labor or other reasons could have similar consequences       if alternate sources of components are not readily available.  ENGINEERING,       RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  We       conduct engineering, research and development primarily to improve the       performance (including fuel efficiency), safety and customer satisfaction of       our       products, and to develop new products. We also have staffs of scientists who       engage in basic research. We maintain extensive engineering, research and design       centers for these purposes, including large centers in Dearborn, Michigan;       Dunton, Gaydon and Whitley, England; Gothenburg, Sweden; and Aachen and       Merkenich, Germany. Most of our engineering research and development relates       to       our Automotive sector. In general, our engineering activities that do not       involve basic research or product development, such as manufacturing       engineering, are excluded from our engineering, research and development charges       discussed below.   During       the last three years, we recorded charges to our consolidated income for       engineering, research and development we sponsored in the following amounts:       $8.0 billion (2005), $7.4 billion (2004), and $7.3 billion (2003). Any       customer-sponsored research and development activities that we conduct are       not       material.            16         ITEM               1. Business (continued)       ITEM       1A. Risk       Factors  We       have       listed below (not necessarily in order of importance or probability of       occurrence) the most significant risk factors applicable to us:  Continued       decline in market share. Our       market share in the United States has declined in each of the past five years,       from 22.8% in 2001 to 18.2% in 2005. Because a high proportion of our costs       are       fixed, these volume reductions have had an adverse impact on our results of       operations. Our plant utilization rate in North America is approximately 75%,       which is not sustainable. While we are attempting to stabilize our market share       and reduce our capacity over time through the steps described in the Way Forward       plan, we cannot be certain that we will be successful. Continued declines in       our       market share could have a substantial adverse effect on our results of       operations and financial condition.  Continued       or increased price competition resulting from industry overcapacity, currency       fluctuations or other factors. The       global automotive industry is intensely competitive, with overall manufacturing       capacity far exceeding current demand. For example, the global automotive       industry is estimated to have had excess capacity of approximately 15 million       units in 2005. Industry overcapacity has resulted in many of our principal       competitors offering marketing incentives on vehicles in an attempt to maintain       market share. These marketing incentives have included a combination of       subsidized financing or leasing programs, price rebates and other incentives.       As       a result, we have not necessarily been able to increase prices sufficiently       to       offset higher costs of marketing incentives or other cost increases (e.g.,       for       commodities or health care) or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations       in       either the U.S. or European markets. While we and General Motors have each       announced plans to significantly reduce capacity, these reductions will take       several years to complete and will only partially address the industry's       overcapacity problems. A continuation or increase in these trends could have       a       substantial adverse effect on our results of operations and financial       condition.  A       market shift (or an increase in or acceleration of market shift) away from       sales       of trucks or sport utility vehicles, or from sales of other more profitable       vehicles in the United States. Trucks       and sport utility vehicles have represented some of the most profitable vehicle       segments in the United States. During the past year, there has been a general       shift in consumer preferences away from medium- and large-sized sport utility       vehicles, which has adversely affected our profitability. A continuation or       acceleration of this general shift in consumer preferences away from sport       utility vehicles, or a similar shift in consumer preferences away from truck       sales or other more profitable vehicle sales, whether because of higher fuel       prices or otherwise, could have an increasingly adverse effect on our results       of       operations and financial condition.   A       significant decline in industry sales, particularly in the United States or       Europe, resulting from slowing economic growth, geo-political events or other       factors. The       worldwide automotive industry is affected significantly by general economic       conditions (among other factors) over which automobile manufacturers have little       control. This is especially so because vehicles are durable goods, which provide       consumers latitude in determining whether and when to replace an existing       vehicle. The decision whether and when to make a vehicle purchase may be       affected significantly by slowing economic growth, geo-political events, and       other factors. Consumer demand may vary substantially from year to year, and,       in       any given year, consumer demand may be affected significantly by general       economic conditions, including the cost of purchasing and operating a vehicle       and the availability and cost of credit and fuel.   Moreover,       like other manufacturers, we have a high proportion of costs that are fixed,       so       that relatively small changes in unit sales volumes may dramatically affect       overall profitability. In recent years, industry demand has remained at high       levels. Should industry demand soften because of slowing or negative economic       growth in key markets or other factors, our results of operations and financial       condition could be substantially adversely affected. For additional discussion       of economic trends, see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of       Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview."  Lower-than-anticipated       market acceptance of new or existing products. Offering       highly desirable vehicles can mitigate the risks of increasing price competition       and declining demand. Conversely, offering vehicles that are perceived to be       less desirable (whether in terms of price, quality, styling, safety, overall       value or otherwise) can exacerbate these risks. For example, if a new model       were       to experience quality issues at the time of launch, the vehicle's perceived       quality could be affected even after the issues had been corrected, resulting       in       lower sales volumes, market share and profitability.   Continued       or increased high prices for or reduced availability of fuel. A       continuation of or further increase in high prices for fuel or reduced       availability of fuel, particularly in the United States, could result in weaker       demand for relatively more profitable large and luxury car and truck models       and       increased demand for relatively less profitable small cars and trucks. An       acceleration          17        ITEM             1A. Risk Factors (continued)      of       such a       trend, as demonstrated in the short-term with the recent spike in fuel prices       following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the U.S. Gulf Coast region, could       have       a substantial adverse effect on our results of operations and financial       condition.   Currency       or commodity price fluctuations.       As a       resource-intensive manufacturing operation, we are exposed to a variety of       market and asset risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency       exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. These risks affect our       Automotive and Financial Services sectors. We monitor and manage these exposures       as an integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes       the       unpredictability of markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects       on our results. Nevertheless, changes in currency exchange rates, commodity       prices and interest rates cannot always be predicted. In addition, because       of       intense price competition and our high level of fixed costs, we may not be       able       to address such changes even if they are foreseeable. Substantial changes in       these rates and prices could have a substantial adverse effect on our results       of       operations and financial condition. For additional discussion of currency or       commodity price risk, see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures       about Market Risk."   Adverse       effects from the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major competitor. We       and       certain of our major competitors have substantial "legacy" costs (principally       related to employee benefits) that put each of us at a competitive disadvantage       to other competitors. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major competitor with       substantial "legacy" costs could result in that competitor gaining a significant       cost advantage (by eliminating or reducing contractual obligations to unions       and       other parties through bankruptcy proceedings). In addition, the bankruptcy       or       insolvency of a major U.S. auto manufacturer likely could lead to substantial       disruptions in the automotive supply base, which could have a substantial       adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.   Economic       distress of suppliers that has in the past and may in the future require us       to       provide financial support or take other measures to ensure supplies of       components or materials.       Automobile manufacturers continue to experience commodity cost pressures and       the       effects of industry overcapacity. These factors have also increased pressure       on       the industry's supply base, as suppliers cope with higher commodity costs,       lower       production volumes and other challenges. We have taken and may continue to       take       actions to provide financial assistance to certain suppliers to ensure an       uninterrupted supply of materials and components. Most significantly, in 2005       we       reacquired from Visteon twenty-three North American facilities in order to       protect our supply of components. In connection with this transaction, we       forgave $1.1 billion of Visteon's liability to us for employee-related costs,       and incurred a pre-tax loss of $468 million.   Work       stoppages at Ford or supplier facilities or other interruptions of       supplies.       A work       stoppage could occur at Ford or supplier facilities, most likely as a result       of       disputes under existing collective bargaining agreements with labor unions,       or       in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements. A       dispute under an existing collective bargaining agreement could arise, for       example, as a result of efforts to implement restructuring actions, such as       those that are part of the Way Forward plan discussed under "Item 7.       Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of       Operations - Overview." A work stoppage for this or other reasons at Ford or       its       suppliers, or an interruption or shortage of supplies for any reason (e.g.,       financial distress, natural disaster or production difficulties affecting a       supplier), if protracted, could substantially adversely affect our results       of       operations and financial condition.   Single-source       supply of components or materials.       Some       components used in our vehicles (e.g., certain engines) are available from       a       single supplier and cannot be quickly or inexpensively re-sourced to another       supplier due to long lead times and contractual commitments that might be       required by another supplier in order to provide the component or materials.       In       addition to the risks described above regarding interruption of supplies, which       are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, the exclusive supplier       of a key component potentially could exert significant bargaining power over       price, quality, warranty claims or other terms relating to a component.   Labor       or other constraints on our ability to restructure our business. Substantially       all of the hourly employees in our Automotive operations in the United States       and Canada are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining       agreements. Our agreement with the United Automobile Workers (which expires       in       September 2007) and our agreement with the Canadian Automobile Workers (which       expires in September 2008) provide for guaranteed wage and benefit levels       throughout their terms and provide for significant employment security. As       a       practical matter, these agreements restrict our ability to eliminate product       lines, close plants, and divest businesses during the terms of the agreements.       These agreements may also limit our ability to change local work rules and       practices to encourage flexible manufacturing and other efficiency-related       improvements. Accordingly, these agreements may impede our ability to       successfully implement and complete the Way Forward plan. For discussion of       the       Way Forward plan, see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial       Condition and Results of Operations - Overview."         18        ITEM             1A. Risk Factors (continued)      Worse-than-assumed       economic and demographic experience for our postretirement benefit plans (e.g.,       discount rates, investment returns, health care cost trends). We       sponsor plans to provide postretirement pension, health care and life insurance       benefits for our retired employees. The measurement of our obligations, costs       and liabilities associated with these benefits requires that we estimate the       present values of projected future payments to all participants. We use many       assumptions in calculating these estimates, including discount rates, investment       returns on designated plan assets, health care cost trends, and demographic       experience (e.g., mortality and retirement rates). To the extent that actual       results are less favorable than our assumptions there could be a substantial       adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. For       additional discussion of these assumptions, see "Item 7. Management's Discussion       and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."  The       discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches,       recall campaigns or increased warranty costs. Meeting       or exceeding many government-mandated safety standards is costly, especially       where standards may conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order       to       meet government-mandated emissions and fuel-economy standards. Government safety       standards also require manufacturers to remedy defects related to motor vehicle       safety through safety recall campaigns, and a manufacturer is obligated to       recall vehicles if it determines that they do not comply with a safety standard.       Should we or government safety regulators determine that a safety defect or       a       noncompliance exists with respect to certain of our vehicles, the cost of such       recall campaigns could be substantial.   Increased       safety, emissions, fuel economy or other (e.g., pension funding) regulation       resulting in higher costs, cash expenditures, and/or sales       restrictions.       The       worldwide automotive industry is governed by a substantial number of       governmental regulations, which often differ by state, region and country.       In       the United States and Europe, for example, governmental regulation has arisen       primarily out of concern for the environment, greater vehicle safety and a       desire for improved fuel economy. Many governments regulate local product       content and/or impose import requirements as a means of creating jobs,       protecting domestic producers and influencing their balance of payments. The       cost of complying with these requirements may be substantial.   Our       ability to comply with CAFE or greenhouse gas emissions standards depends       heavily on the alignment of these standards with actual consumer demand. If       consumers demand vehicles that are relatively large, have high performance,       and/or are feature-laden while regulatory standards are skewed toward vehicles       that are smaller and more economical, compliance becomes problematic. Moreover,       if regulatory requirements call for rapid, substantial increases in fleet       average fuel economy (or decreases in fleet average greenhouse gas emissions),       the Company may not have adequate resources and time to make major product       changes across most or all of its vehicle fleet. If significant increases in       CAFE standards are imposed beyond those presently in effect or proposed, or       if       state greenhouse gas regulations are not overturned, we may be forced to take       various costly actions that could have substantial adverse effects on our sales       volume and profits. For example, we may have to curtail production of certain       vehicles such as family-size, luxury, and high-performance cars and full-size       light-trucks; restrict offerings of selected engines and popular options; and/or       increase market support programs for our most fuel-efficient cars and       light-trucks in order to maintain compliance. See "Item 1. Governmental       Standards" for additional discussion.   Unusual       or significant litigation or governmental investigations arising out of alleged       defects in our products or otherwise.       We spend       substantial resources ensuring compliance with governmental safety and other       standards. However, compliance with governmental standards does not necessarily       prevent individual or class action lawsuits, which can entail significant cost       and risk. For example, the preemptive effect of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety       Standards is often a contested issue in litigation, and some courts have       permitted liability findings even where our vehicles comply with federal law.       Furthermore, simply responding to litigation or government investigations of       our       compliance with regulatory standards requires significant expenditures of time       and other resources.   A       change in our requirements for parts or materials where we have entered into       long-term supply arrangements that commit us to purchase minimum or fixed       quantities of certain parts or materials, or to pay a minimum amount to the       seller ("take-or-pay contracts"). We       have       entered into a number of long-term supply contracts that require us to purchase       a fixed quantity of parts to be used in the production of our vehicles. If       our       need for any of these parts were to lessen, we could still be required to       purchase a specified quantity of the part or pay a minimum amount to the seller       pursuant to the take-or-pay contract. We also have entered into a small number       of long-term supply contracts for raw materials (for example, precious metals       used in catalytic converters) that require us to purchase a fixed percentage       of       mine output. If our need for any of these raw materials were to lessen, or       if a       supplier's output of materials were to increase, we could be required to       purchase more materials than we need.  Inability       to access debt or securitization markets around the world at competitive rates       or in sufficient amounts due to additional credit rating downgrades or       otherwise.        Recent       lowering of credit ratings for Ford and Ford Credit has increased borrowing       costs and caused Ford Credit's access to the unsecured debt markets to become       more restricted. In response, Ford Credit has increased its          19        ITEM             1A. Risk Factors (continued)      use       of       securitization and other sources of liquidity. Over time, and particularly       in       the event of any further credit rating downgrades or a significant decline       in       the demand for the types of securities it offers, Ford Credit may need to reduce       the amount of receivables it purchases. A significant reduction in the amount       of       purchased receivables would significantly reduce ongoing profits and could       adversely affect Ford Credit's ability to support the sale of Ford vehicles.       For       additional discussion, see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of       Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital       Resources."   Higher-than-expected       credit losses.        Credit       risk is the possibility of loss from a customer's or dealer's failure to make       payments according to contract terms. Credit risk (which is heavily dependent       upon economic factors including unemployment, consumer debt service burden,       personal income growth, dealer profitability and used car prices) has a       significant impact on Ford Credit's business. The level of credit losses Ford       Credit may experience could exceed its expectations. For additional discussion       regarding credit losses, see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis       of       Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting       Estimates."  Increased       competition from banks or other financial institutions seeking to increase       their       share of financing Ford vehicles. No       single       company is a dominant force in the automotive finance industry. Some of Ford       Credit's bank competitors in the United States have developed credit aggregation       systems that permit dealers to send, through a single standard system, retail       credit applications to multiple finance sources to evaluate financing options       offered by these finance sources. This process has resulted in greater       competition based on financing rates. In addition, Ford Credit is facing       increased competition from banks on wholesale financing for Ford dealers.       Competition from such competitors may increase, which could adversely affect       Ford Credit's profitability and the volume of its business.   Changes       in interest rates.       Ford       Credit is exposed to interest rate risk, and the particular market to which       it       is most exposed is U.S. dollar LIBOR. Ford Credit's interest rate risk exposure       results principally from "re-pricing risk,'' or differences in the re-pricing       characteristics of assets and liabilities. Any inability to adequately control       this exposure could adversely affect its business. For additional discussion       of       interest rate risk, see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures       about       Market Risk."  Collection       and servicing problems related to finance receivables and net investment in       operating leases.       After       Ford Credit purchases retail installment sale contracts and leases from dealers       and other customers, it manages or services the receivables. Any disruption       of       its servicing activity, due to inability to access or accurately maintain       customer account records or otherwise, could have a significant negative impact       on its ability to collect on those receivables and/or satisfy its customers.         Lower-than-anticipated       residual values or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased       vehicles.        Ford       Credit projects expected residual values (including residual value support       payments from Ford) of the vehicles it leases. Actual proceeds realized by       Ford       Credit upon the sale of returned leased vehicles at lease termination may be       lower than the amount projected, which reduces the profitability of the lease       transaction. Among the factors that can affect the value of returned lease       vehicles are the volume of vehicles returned, economic conditions, and the       quality or perceived quality, safety or reliability of the vehicles. All of       these, alone or in combination, have the potential to adversely affect Ford       Credit's profitability. For additional discussion regarding residual value,       see       "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results       of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates."  New       or increased credit, consumer or data protection or other regulations resulting       in higher costs and/or additional financing       restrictions.        As a       finance company, Ford Credit is highly regulated by governmental authorities       in       the locations where it operates. In the United States, its operations are       subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal, state       and local laws and regulations, including the federal Truth-in-Lending Act,       Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act. In some countries       outside the United States, Ford Credit's subsidiaries are regulated banking       institutions and are required, among other things, to maintain minimum capital       reserves. In many other locations, governmental authorities require companies       to       have licenses in order to conduct financing businesses. Efforts to comply with       these laws and regulations impose significant costs on Ford Credit, and affect       the conduct of its business. Additional regulation could add significant cost       or       operational constraints that might impair its profitability.   Inability       to implement the Way Forward plan. We       believe that our ability to implement the Way Forward plan is very important       to       our future success. Any of the above or other factors that prevent us from       executing the Way Forward plan ultimately could have a substantially adverse       impact on our business. For additional discussion of the Way Forward plan,       see       "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results       of Operations - Overview."           20                 ITEM       1B. Unresolved       Staff Comments  We       have       no unresolved SEC staff comments to report.   ITEM       2.       Properties   Our       principal properties include manufacturing and assembly facilities, distribution       centers, warehouses, sales or administrative offices and engineering       centers.       We       own       substantially all of our U.S. manufacturing and assembly facilities. These       facilities are situated in various sections of the country and include assembly       plants, engine plants, casting plants, metal stamping plants, and transmission       plants. Most of our distribution centers are leased (approximately 38% of our       total square footage is owned). A substantial amount of our warehousing is       provided by third-party providers under service contracts. Because the       facilities provided pursuant to third-party service contracts need not be       dedicated exclusively or even primarily to our use, these spaces are not       included in the number of distribution centers/warehouses listed in the table       below. All of the warehouses that we operate are leased, although many of our       manufacturing and assembly facilities contain some warehousing space.       Substantially all of our sales offices are leased space. Approximately 92%       of       the total square footage of our engineering centers and our supplementary       research and development space is owned by us.      In       addition,       we maintain and operate manufacturing plants, assembly facilities, parts       distribution centers, and engineering centers outside the United States. We       own       substantially all of our non-U.S. manufacturing plants, assembly facilities,       and       engineering centers. The majority of our parts distribution centers outside       of       the United States are either leased or provided by vendors under service       contracts. As in the United States, space provided by vendors under service       contracts need not be dedicated exclusively or even primarily to our use, and       is       not included in the number of distribution centers/warehouses listed in the       table below. The total number of plants, distribution centers/warehouses,       engineering and research and development sites, and sales offices used by our       Automotive segments are shown in the table below:         Segment       Plants     Distribution Centers/Warehouses     Engineering, Research/Development       Sales                 Offices       The                 Americas       61       33       41       38       Ford                 Europe and PAG       38       11       9       27       Ford                 Asia-Pacific and Africa/Mazda       14       3       2       5       Total       113       47       52       70         Included       in the number of plants shown above are several plants that are not       operated directly by us, but rather by consolidated joint ventures that operate       plants that support our Automotive sector. Following are the most significant       of       these consolidated joint ventures and the number of plants they own:   •  AutoAlliance       International ("AAI")— a       50/50       joint venture with Mazda (of which we own approximately 33.4%), which operates       as its principal business an automobile                 vehicle assembly plant in Flat Rock, Michigan. AAI currently produces the       Mazda6 and Ford Mustang models. Ford supplies all of the hourly and       substantially all of the                salaried labor requirements to AAI, and AAI reimburses Ford for the full cost       of       that labor.   •  Ford       Otosan— a       joint       venture in Turkey between Ford (41% partner), the Koc Group of Turkey (41%       partner) and public investors (18%) that is our single source supplier       of                 the Ford Transit Connect vehicle and our sole distributor of Ford vehicles       in       Turkey. In addition, Ford Otosan makes the Ford Transit series and the Cargo       truck for the                 Turkish and export markets, and certain engines and transmissions, most of       which       are under license. This joint venture owns and operates two plants and a parts       distribution                 depot in Turkey.    •                Getrag Ford Transmissions GmbH— a       50/50       joint venture with Getrag Deutsche Venture GmbH and Co. KG, a German company,       to       which we transferred our       European                        manual transmission       operations in Halewood, England; Cologne, Germany; and Bordeaux, France. In       2004, Volvo Car Corporation ("Volvo Cars") agreed to transfer its       manual                    transmission operations from its Köping, Sweden plant to this joint venture. The         Getrag joint venture produces manual transmissions for our operations in         Europe         (Ford                   Europe and PAG). Ford currently supplies most of the hourly and salaried         labor         requirements of the operations transferred to this Getrag joint venture.         Ford         employees who                   worked at the manual transmission operations transferred at the time of         formation of the joint venture are assigned to the joint venture by Ford.         In the         event of surplus labor at                   the joint venture, Ford employees assigned to the joint venture may return         to         Ford. Employees hired in the future to work in           21         ITEM               2. Properties (continued)                                 these operations will be employed directly by the       joint       venture. Getrag Ford Transmissions GmbH reimburses Ford for the full cost of       the       hourly and salaried labor supplied                           by Ford.       This joint venture operates three plants.   •  Getrag       All Wheel Drive AB— a       joint       venture in Sweden between Getrag Dana Holding GmbH ("Getrag/Dana") (60% partner)       and Volvo Cars (40% partner). In January 2004,           Volvo       Cars entered into agreements with Getrag/Dana to transfer Volvo Cars’ plant in       Köping, Sweden to this joint venture. The joint venture produces all-wheel       drive                 components and, for a time, chassis components as well. As noted above, the       manual transmission operations at the Köping plant were transferred to Getrag       Ford                 Transmissions GmbH. The hourly and salaried employees at the plant have become       employees of the joint venture.   •  TEKFOR       Cologne GmbH ("TEKFOR")— a       50/50       joint venture of Ford-Werke GmbH ("Ford-Werke") together with Neumayer Tekfor       GmbH, a German company, to which                  Ford-Werke transferred the operations of the Ford forge in Cologne. The       joint venture produces forged components, primarily for transmissions and       chassis, for use in Ford                   vehicles and for sale to third parties. Those Ford employees who worked at       the       Cologne Forge Plant at the time of the formation of the joint venture are       assigned to TEKFOR                 by Ford and remain Ford employees. In the event of surplus labor at the joint       venture, Ford employees assigned to TEKFOR may return to Ford. New workers       at       the joint                 venture will be hired as employees of the joint venture. TEKFOR reimburses       Ford       for the full cost of Ford employees assigned to the joint venture. This joint       venture operates                 one plant.   •  Pininfarina       Sverige, AB— a       joint       venture between Volvo Cars (40% partner) and Pininfarina, S.p.A. ("Pininfarina")       (60% partner). In September 2003, Volvo Cars entered into          agreements       with Pininfarina to establish this joint venture for the engineering and       manufacture of niche vehicles, starting with a new, small convertible. Volvo       Cars has                outsourced the design and engineering to Pininfarina. The joint venture began       production of the new car at the Uddevalla Plant in Sweden, which was       transferred from Volvo                Cars to the joint venture in December 2005, and is the joint venture’s only       plant.   •  Ford       Vietnam Limited— a       joint       venture between Ford (75% partner) and Song Cong Diesel (25% partner).

ITEM       3.       Legal Proceedings  OVERVIEW         Various       legal actions, governmental investigations and proceedings and claims are       pending or may be instituted or asserted in the future against us and our       subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, those arising out of the following:       alleged defects in our products; governmental regulations covering safety,       emissions and fuel economy; financial services; employment-related matters;       dealer, supplier, and other contractual relationships; intellectual property       rights; product warranties; environmental matters; shareholder and investor       matters; and financial reporting matters. Some of the pending legal actions       are,       or purport to be, class actions. Some of the foregoing matters involve or may       involve compensatory, punitive or antitrust or other multiplied damage claims       in       very large amounts, or demands for recall campaigns, environmental remediation       programs, sanctions or other relief that, if granted, would require very large       expenditures. We regularly evaluate the expected outcome of product liability       litigation and other litigation matters. We have accrued expenses for probable       losses on product liability matters, in the aggregate, based on an analysis       of       historical litigation payouts and trends. We have also accrued expenses for       other litigation where losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable.       These accruals are reflected in our financial statements.  Following       is a discussion of our significant pending legal proceedings:          23        ITEM             3. Legal Proceedings (continued)       PRODUCT       LIABILITY MATTERS   Asbestos       Matters.       Asbestos       was used in brakes, clutches and other automotive components dating from the       early 1900s. Along with other vehicle manufacturers, we have been the target       of       asbestos litigation and, as a result, we are a defendant in various actions       for       injuries claimed to have resulted from alleged contact with certain Ford parts       and other products containing asbestos. Plaintiffs in these personal injury       cases allege various health problems as a result of asbestos exposure, either       from component parts found in older vehicles, insulation or other asbestos       products in our facilities, or asbestos aboard our former maritime fleet. The       majority of these cases have been filed in state courts.  Most       of       the asbestos litigation we face involves mechanics or other individuals who       have       worked on the brakes of our vehicles over the years. In most of the asbestos       litigation we are not the sole defendant. We believe we are being more       aggressively targeted in asbestos suits because many previously targeted       companies have filed for bankruptcy. We are prepared to defend these       asbestos-related cases and, with respect to the cases alleging exposure from       our       brakes, believe that the scientific evidence confirms our long-standing position       that mechanics and others are not at an increased risk of asbestos-related       disease as a result of exposure to the type of asbestos formerly used in the       brakes on our vehicles.  The       extent of our financial exposure to asbestos litigation remains very difficult       to estimate. The majority of our asbestos cases do not specify a dollar amount       for damages, and in many of the other cases the dollar amount specified is       the       jurisdictional minimum. The vast majority of these cases involve multiple       defendants, with the number in some cases exceeding one hundred. Many of these       cases also involve multiple plaintiffs, and we are often unable to tell from       the       pleadings which of the plaintiffs are making claims against us (as opposed       to       other defendants). Our annual payout and related defense costs in asbestos       cases       had been increasing between 1999 and 2003. In 2005, these costs were about       the       same as in 2003 and 2004; however, they may become substantial in the       future.                  The United States Congress continues to consider proposals to reform asbestos       litigation. The leading proposal would create a trust fund from which eligible       asbestos claimants would be compensated and would preclude, during the life       of       the trust, litigation in the United States based on exposure to asbestos. The       trust fund would be funded by asbestos defendants (including us) and the       insurance industry. These funds would be used to pay eligible claimants (i.e.,       those who satisfy specific medical criteria and can adequately demonstrate       occupational exposure to asbestos) according to a specified schedule. If       legislation is enacted creating such a trust fund, we would likely be required       to make substantial contributions to the fund over a specified period of time,       resulting in our incurring a charge in the amount of the present value of such       anticipated contributions in the period in which the legislation becomes       effective. We cannot predict whether or in what form the legislation will be       enacted or the costs associated with such enactment.    ENVIRONMENTAL       MATTERS   General.       We have       received notices under various federal and state environmental laws that we       (along with others) may be a potentially responsible party for the costs       associated with remediating numerous hazardous substance storage, recycling       or       disposal sites in many states and, in some instances, for natural resource       damages. We also may have been a generator of hazardous substances at a number       of other sites. The amount of any such costs or damages for which we may be       held       responsible could be substantial. The contingent losses that we expect to incur       in connection with many of these sites have been accrued and those losses are       reflected in our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted       accounting principles. However, for many sites, the remediation costs and other       damages for which we ultimately may be responsible are not reasonably estimable       because of uncertainties with respect to factors such as our connection to       the       site or to materials there, the involvement of other potentially responsible       parties, the application of laws and other standards or regulations, site       conditions, and the nature and scope of investigations, studies, and remediation       to be undertaken (including the technologies to be required and the extent,       duration, and success of remediation). As a result, we are unable to determine       or reasonably estimate the amount of costs or other damages for which we are       potentially responsible in connection with these sites, although that total       could be substantial.          24         ITEM               3. Legal Proceedings (continued)        St.       Louis Assembly Plant Enforcement Action.       In 2005,       the Department of Justice ("DOJ") advised us that the EPA had referred to it       for       civil enforcement a matter regarding refrigerants used in several types of       process equipment at our St. Louis Assembly Plant. The referral is based on       the       EPA's belief that the plant did not comply with all of the Clean Air Act’s       recordkeeping, testing, and repair requirements related to process equipment       with regulated refrigerants. We are fully cooperating with the DOJ to resolve       this matter, and continue to negotiate a resolution.   Woodhaven       Stamping Plant Letter of Violation. In       2005,       the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality ("DEQ") issued a letter of       violation to Ford's Woodhaven Stamping Plant alleging that the facility had       failed to properly report emissions from boilers and space heaters, and that       the       facility had failed to apply for a Title V permit as required by Michigan law.       We are fully cooperating with the DEQ to resolve this matter, and continue       to       negotiate a resolution.  Edison       Assembly Plant Concrete Disposal. During       demolition of our Edison Assembly Plant, we discovered very low levels of       contaminants in the concrete slab. The concrete was crushed and reused as fill       material at several different off-site locations. The New Jersey Department       of       Environmental Protection ("DEP") now asserts that some of these locations may       not have been authorized to receive the waste. We are fully cooperating with       the       DEP to resolve this matter, and continue to negotiate a resolution.   CLASS       ACTIONS   The       following are actions filed against us on behalf of individual plaintiffs and       all others similarly situated (i.e., purported class actions). In light of       the       fact that very few of the purported class actions filed against us in the past       have ever been certified by the courts as class actions, the actions listed       below are limited to those (i) that have been certified as a class action by       a       court of competent jurisdiction (and any additional purported class actions       that       raise allegations substantially similar to a certified case), and (ii) that,       if       resolved unfavorably to the Company, would likely involve a significant       cost.  Explorer       Class Actions.       A state       court in Illinois certified a statewide class of purchasers and lessees of       1991-2001 Ford Explorers equipped with Firestone ATX or Wilderness tires who       have not experienced any problems with either the tires or the vehicles (Rowan       v. Ford Motor Company).       The       complaint alleges that Explorers are unstable and that the Firestone tires       are       defective. Plaintiffs claim that the value of the vehicles was diminished       because of the alleged defects and seek unspecified actual and compensatory       damages and other relief. Trial is anticipated in late 2006 or       2007.  A       state       court in California certified a statewide class of purchasers and lessees of       1990-2000 Ford Explorers (Gray       v. Ford Motor Company and       four       coordinated cases). The complaint alleges that Explorers are unstable and that       Ford concealed information about them. Plaintiffs seek relief similar to that       sought in Rowan.       Trial       is scheduled for late 2006.  There       are       also 16 purported statewide class actions pending in several states, raising       allegations similar to those raised in Rowan       and       in Gray,       and       seeking similar relief. Bridgestone-Firestone, Inc. ("Firestone") was a       co-defendant in most of these cases, but settled all claims against it in these       cases. The only remaining claims in these cases are based on the Explorer’s       alleged rollover propensity.  Paint       Class Actions.       A state       court in Madison County, Illinois certified a nationwide class of owners of       1989-96 model year vehicles that have experienced paint peeling. Plaintiffs       contend that their vehicles' paint is defective in that there was a substantial       risk of topcoat or clearcoat delamination, and that Ford failed to disclose       that       risk. Plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages (in an amount to cover       the cost of repainting their vehicles and to compensate for alleged diminution       in value), punitive damages, attorneys' fees and interest. Trial is scheduled       for late 2006.   Crown       Victoria Police Interceptor Class Actions.       State       courts in Illinois and Louisiana certified statewide classes of state and local       governments that purchased or leased Crown Victoria Police Interceptors. The       complaints allege that the vehicles are defective in that fires can occur when       the vehicles are struck in the rear at high speed, and seek modifications to       the       fuel systems and other relief, including punitive damages. Trial in the Illinois       case during 2004 (St.       Clair County v Ford Motor Company) resulted       in a defense verdict on all counts submitted to the jury, from which plaintiffs       have appealed; three counts remain pending for decision by the trial judge.       Our       appeal from the class certification order in Louisiana is pending. A class       certification order granted in Florida in 2004 was reversed on appeal in April       2005.          25        ITEM             3. Legal Proceedings (continued)        There       are       also 12 purported statewide class actions pending in several states which claim       to represent state and local governments that purchased or leased Crown Victoria       Police Interceptors, as well as six purported class actions relating to       non-police Crown Victoria vehicles. These suits raise allegations similar to       those raised in St.       Clair County,       and       seek similar relief.  Hydroboost       Truck Brake Class Action.       A state       court in Oklahoma certified a nationwide class of all purchasers of 1999-2002       F-250, F-350, F-450, and F-550 Ford Super Duty Trucks and 2002 Excursions with       hydroboost hydraulic braking systems. The complaint alleges that these trucks       are unsafe because they suffer diminished power assist to the steering when       the       driver is simultaneously braking and steering. The complaint alleges breach       of       warranty and fraud, and seeks the cost of retrofitting the trucks to eliminate       the alleged danger, compensation for diminished resale value, and other amounts.       NHTSA investigated a similar issue and closed the investigation, finding that       "diminished steering assist while braking is present" in these trucks, but       that       the "associated injury and property damage incidents are so rare that they       do       not present a risk to vehicle safety." Trial is scheduled for 2007.   OTHER       MATTERS  SEC       Pension and Post-Employment Benefit Accounting Inquiry.       On       October 14, 2004, the Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange       Commission ("SEC") notified us that it was conducting an inquiry into the       methodology used to account for pensions and other post-employment benefits.       We       are one of several companies to receive a request for information as part of       this inquiry. We are cooperating with the SEC in providing the information       requested.   ITEM       4.       Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders  Not       required.           26                 ITEM       4A.

Of       the       6,968,370 shares purchased, 6,954,640 shares were purchased from the Ford Motor       Company Savings and Stock Investment Plan for Salaried Employees ("SSIP") and       the Tax Efficient Savings Plan for Hourly Employees ("TESPHE"). Shares are       generally purchased from SSIP and TESPHE when participants in those plans elect       to sell units in the Ford Stock Fund upon retirement, upon termination of       employment with the Company, related to an in-service distribution, or to fund       a       loan against an existing account balance in the Ford Stock Fund. Shares are       not       purchased from these plans when a participant transfers account balances out       of       the Ford Stock Fund and into another investment option under the plans. For       the       full year 2005, we purchased 25,823,410 shares on such basis from participants       in SSIP and TESPHE. The remaining shares were acquired from our employees or       directors in accordance with our various compensation plans as a result of       share       withholdings to pay income taxes with respect to: (i) the lapse of restrictions       on restricted stock, (ii) the issuance of unrestricted stock, including       issuances as a result of the conversion of restricted stock equivalents, or       (iii) to pay the exercise price and related income taxes with respect to       certain exercises of stock options.          29                   ITEM       6.

Management’s       Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   OVERVIEW  Generation       of Revenue, Income and Cash  Our       Automotive sector’s revenue, income and cash are generated primarily from sales       of vehicles to our dealers and distributors (i.e., our customers). Vehicles       we       produce generally are subject to firm orders from our customers and generally       are deemed sold (with the proceeds from such sale recognized in revenue)       immediately after they are produced and shipped to our customers. This       is       not the case, however, with respect to vehicles produced for sale to daily       rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option or       vehicles produced for use in our own fleet (including management evaluation       vehicles). Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies that are subject to       a       guaranteed repurchase option are accounted for as operating leases, with lease       revenue and profits recognized over the term of the lease. When we sell the       vehicle at auction, we recognize a gain or loss on the difference, if any,       between actual auction value and the projected auction value.       Therefore, except for the impact of the daily rental units sold subject to       a       guaranteed repurchase option and those units placed into our own fleet, vehicle       production is closely linked with unit sales and revenue from such       sales.  Most       of       the vehicles sold by us to our dealers and distributors are financed at       wholesale by Ford Credit. Upon Ford Credit originating the wholesale receivable       related to a dealer’s purchase of a vehicle, Ford Credit pays cash to the       relevant legal entity in our Automotive sector in payment of the dealer’s       obligation for the purchase price of the vehicle. The dealer then pays off       the       wholesale finance receivable when it sells the vehicle to a retail       customer.  Our       Financial Services sector’s revenue is generated primarily from interest on       finance receivables, net of certain deferred origination costs that are included       as a reduction of financing revenue, and such revenue is recognized over the       term of the receivable using the interest method. Also, revenue from operating       leases, net of certain deferred origination costs, is recognized on a       straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Income is generated to the       extent revenues exceed expenses, most of which are interest and operating       expenses.  Transactions       between the Automotive and Financial Services sectors occur in the ordinary       course of business. For example, Ford Credit receives interest supplements       and       other support cost payments from the Automotive sector in connection with       special vehicle financing and leasing programs that it sponsors. Ford Credit       records these payments as revenue, and the Automotive sector makes the related       cash payments, over the term of the related finance receivable or operating       lease. The Automotive sector records the estimated costs of marketing       incentives, including dealer and retail customer cash payments (e.g., rebates)       and costs of special financing and leasing programs, as a reduction to revenue       at the later of the date the related vehicle sales are recorded or at the date       the incentive program is both approved and communicated. See Note 1 of the       Notes       to Financial Statements for a more detailed discussion of transactions and       payments between the Automotive and Financial Services sectors.  Key       Economic Factors and Trends Affecting the Automotive       Industry  Excess       Capacity. According       to CSM Worldwide, an automotive research firm, in 2005 the estimated automotive       industry global production capacity for light vehicles (about 77 million       units) significantly exceeded global production of cars and trucks (about       62 million units). In North America and Europe, the two regions where the       majority of revenue and profits are earned in the industry, excess capacity       was       an estimated 17% and 14%, respectively. According to production capacity data       projected by CSM Worldwide, excess capacity conditions in North America could       continue for several more years, but would be mitigated by the capacity       reductions announced by us and General Motors Corporation when these planned       reductions are completed.  Pricing       Pressure. Excess       capacity, coupled with a proliferation of new products being introduced in       key       segments by the industry,       will keep pressure on manufacturers' ability to increase prices on their       products. In addition, the incremental new U.S. manufacturing capacity of       foreign manufacturers (so-called "transplants") in recent years has contributed,       and is likely to continue to contribute, to the severe pricing pressure in       that       market. For example, in 2006, Toyota Motor Corporation is expected to complete       construction of an assembly plant in Texas that reportedly will be capable       of       producing at least 200,000 full-size pick-up trucks per year. The reduction       of       real prices for similarly contented vehicles in the United States has become       more pronounced since the late 1990s, and we expect that a challenging pricing       environment will continue for some time to come. In Europe, the automotive       industry also has experienced intense pricing pressure for several years for       the       same reasons discussed above, exacerbated in recent years by the       Block       Exemption Regulation discussed above in "Item 1. Business - Automotive       Sector."         31        ITEM             7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results             of             Operations (continued)       Consumer       Spending Trends. We       expect, however, that a decline in or the inability to increase vehicle prices       could be offset by the spending habits of consumers and their propensity to       purchase over time higher-end, more expensive vehicles and/or vehicles with       more       features. Over the next decade, in the United States and other mature markets,       we expect that growth in spending on vehicle mix and content will change       generally in line with GDP. The benefits of this to revenue growth in the       automotive industry are significant. In the United States, for example,       consumers in the highest income bracket are buying more often and are more       frequently buying upscale.  Although       growth in vehicle unit sales (i.e., volume) will be greatest in emerging markets       in the next decade, we expect that the mature automotive markets (e.g., North       America, Western Europe, and Japan) will continue to be the source of a majority       of global industry revenues. We also expect that the North American market       will       continue as the single largest source of revenue for the automotive industry       in       the world.  Health       Care Expenses. In       2005,       our health care expenses for U.S. employees, retirees, and their dependents       were       $3.5 billion, with about $2.4 billion for postretirement health care       and the balance for active employee health care. In 2005, prescription drugs       continued to represent approximately one-third of our total health care expense.         Although       we have taken measures to have employees and retirees bear a higher portion       of       the costs of their health care benefits, we expect our health care costs to       continue to increase. For 2006, our trend assumptions for U.S. health care       costs       include an initial trend rate of 7%, gradually declining to a steady state       trend       rate of 5% reached in 2011. These assumptions include the effect of actions       we       are taking and expect to take to offset health care inflation, including       eligibility management, employee education and wellness programs, competitive       sourcing, and appropriate employee cost sharing.  Commodity       and Energy Price Increases. Commodity       price increases, particularly for steel and resins (which are our two largest       commodity exposures and among the most difficult to hedge), have occurred       recently and are continuing during a period of strong global demand for these       materials. In addition, energy prices increased significantly in 2005. In       particular, gasoline prices in the United States increased in volatility and       rose to levels well over $2.00 per gallon in 2005, and have remained at levels       significantly higher than 2004. This has had an adverse effect on the demand       for       full- and medium-sized sport utility vehicles in the United States.  Currency       Exchange Rate Volatility. The       U.S.       dollar has depreciated against most major currencies since 2002. This created       downward margin pressure on auto manufacturers that have U.S. dollar revenue       with foreign currency cost. Because we produce vehicles in Europe (e.g., Jaguar,       Land Rover and Volvo models) for sale in the United States and produce       components in Europe (e.g., engines) for use in some of our North American       vehicles, we experienced margin pressure. Although this pressure was offset       partially by gains on foreign exchange derivatives, this offset reduces over       time due to the expiration of favorable hedges previously put in place. We,       like       many other automotive manufacturers with sales in the United States, are not       always able to price for depreciation of the U.S. dollar due to the extremely       competitive pricing environment in the United States.          32        ITEM             7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results             of             Operations (continued)     Trends       and Strategies - the Way Forward Plan  The       global automotive marketplace has become increasingly fragmented and crowded,       and we anticipate that this trend will accelerate into the future. Anticipating       little growth in the overall volume of vehicles sold in North America for the       foreseeable future, we expect more manufacturers to offer an increasing number       of products. Presently, there are about 255 different nameplates being       offered in the United States, compared with 215 in 2002 and a projected 300       or       more by 2010. In order to stabilize and grow our U.S. market share in this       increasingly competitive environment and generally improve our business, we       are       implementing a business improvement plan for our North American automotive       operations that we refer to as our Way Forward plan. This plan focuses on the       following key areas: renewed customer focus and brand differentiation,       commitment to innovation, clear pricing, and cost reductions.   Customer       Focus and Brand Differentiation  To       compete more effectively in today's global marketplace, a sharpened customer       focus is essential. Toward that end, we have developed a new customer       segmentation model using a proprietary large-scale quantitative survey to better       understand the values and attitudes in the U.S. marketplace. This model focuses       on values and attitudes that drive purchase behaviors and that cross traditional       demographic lines of age, lifestage, gender and cultural identity. Using this       new segmentation model, we selected target customer segments for our Ford,       Lincoln, and Mercury brands. These target customer segments will provide a       sharper focus for our business, and we will use this focus to ensure all aspects       of our business will be aligned to satisfy our customers' current needs and       anticipate their future needs.   To       effectively leverage our global resources, we must focus on differentiating       our       brand identities, especially within the crowded North American marketplace.       Going forward, we intend to have clear and distinct identities for our brands.       Our Ford brand in the United States stands for bold American design that exudes       strength and progress; a number of our products already reflect that design       philosophy, including our award-winning Mustang, F-Series, and Fusion models.       We       plan to continue this brand philosophy in future Ford-brand models, such as       the       new Ford Edge crossover vehicle. Mercury appeals to consumers with different       values and attitudes, and brings conquest purchasers to us. Our strategy for       the       Mercury brand is to create vehicles that offer modern, expressive design for       the       American consumer, while maintaining common product functionality with the       Ford       brand. The Mercury Mariner and Mercury Milan are examples of products delivering       the intended brand identity and product functionality. Our strategy for Lincoln       is to appeal to self-made American consumers who are achieving their dreams,       by       offering these consumers refined and dynamic vehicle design, smooth power on       demand, and a personalized environment. The Lincoln Zephyr and Lincoln Navigator       are examples of products delivering this brand identity today, and this brand       philosophy will be continued in future products, such as the new Lincoln MKX       crossover vehicle.   Innovation       Initiative  To       continue delivering the cutting-edge technology consumers desire, we also are       rededicating ourselves to driving innovation through our entire business,       beginning with the way we analyze the marketplace, develop and produce products,       and continuing through the sales and service channels. Our innovation initiative       demands creative and original thinking, implemented through a disciplined       process, throughout our global operations, which we can then maximize through       global synergies in order to create more new products and features, more       flexible plants, more common processes and economies of scale to deliver more       new product faster to all of our markets and for all of our brands. Our strategy       is to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace through design       innovation, safety innovation, and new environmentally-friendly technologies.         Clear       Pricing  We       began       introducing clear, simple pricing two years ago with the introduction of the       new       Mustang, and have continued this strategy with new models such as the Ford       Fusion, Mercury Milan and Lincoln Zephyr. These vehicles are proving that well       priced products with great appeal can reduce our reliance on incentives. Our       plan is to extend this strategy to all of our vehicles over time. This is a       key       component of communicating our brand philosophy to our customers through bold       styling and clear, simple pricing. Ford will continue this approach of bringing       sticker prices in line with actual transaction prices by reducing rebates over       time as we introduce new models into the marketplace. Our customers will benefit       from a simpler purchase experience and improved residual values and cost of       ownership.          33        ITEM             7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results             of             Operations (continued)     Cost       Savings  To       improve our business and profitability, we plan to reduce our costs through       material cost actions, health care cost reductions, and capacity and personnel       reductions.  Material       Cost Actions.       During       2005, we announced an initiative to enter into new long-term agreements with       select strategic suppliers globally in order to strengthen collaboration and       develop a sustainable business model to drive mutual profitability and       technology development. This new Aligned Business Framework is expected to       establish closer relationships with a smaller number of suppliers, reducing       by       approximately 50 percent the number of suppliers to whom we source new       business for 20 high-impact component systems. These systems, including seats,       wiring, restraint systems, and instrument and trim panels, represent about       half       of our annual production purchases globally. In addition, we have established       cross-functional component systems teams with common objectives and processes       to       establish component systems business plans with the goal of further reducing       material costs. With these actions, we are targeting net material cost       reductions excluding special items of at least $6 billion by 2010 at       constant volume, mix and exchange, net of new product content and regulatory       changes.   As       disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated October 1, 2005, we       also finalized an agreement with Visteon Corporation ("Visteon"), our largest       supplier, in which we assumed control of 17       plants and six other facilities in the United States and Mexico. These       assets were transferred to Automotive Components Holdings, LLC ("ACH"), a       temporary business controlled and managed by us, to protect the flow of critical       parts and components in the near-term and, over time, to improve our sourcing       flexibility and cost competitiveness. ACH's mission is to prepare most of the       acquired businesses for sale to companies with the capital and expertise to       supply us with high-quality components and systems at competitive prices. As       we       prepare these businesses for sale, we also are taking actions to reduce hourly       employment at ACH by approximately 5,000 positions, primarily through buyouts.         Health       Care Cost Reductions.       Effective January 1, 2007 for U.S. salaried employees hired before       June 1, 2001, we established a company contribution limit set at 2006       levels for retiree health care benefits (U.S. salaried employees hired on or       after June 1, 2001 participate in a defined contribution retiree       health care plan). In addition, for U.S. salaried employees hired before       January 1, 2004 who retire on or after June 1, 2006,       company-paid retiree life insurance benefits are limited to $50,000 (employees       hired on or after January 1, 2004 do not receive company-paid retiree       life insurance benefits). These benefit changes resulted in a decrease in the       year-end 2005 other postretirement employee benefit ("OPEB") obligation of       about       $3 billion and a reduction in 2006 and ongoing expense of about       $400 million annually. The related cash savings will grow over       time.  In       December 2005, we reached an agreement with the UAW that would increase retiree       health care cost sharing. As part of the agreement, an independent defined       contribution Voluntary Employee Benefit Association trust would be established       for the purpose of mitigating the financial impact of increased cost sharing       to       retirees. This trust would be funded primarily through (i) wage diversions       from active hourly employees, (ii) specified cash contributions aggregating       $108 million to be made by us over several years, and (iii) potential cash       contributions to be made by us based on any price appreciation above       $8.145 per share of a notional amount of 8,750,000 shares of Ford       Common Stock. The agreement is subject to court approval of a proposed       settlement of a purported class action challenging our decision to modify the       retiree health care plan; additional retirees have expressed their objection       to       the agreement by moving to intervene in the pending lawsuit and filing a       follow-on suit of their own. If the settlement of the purported class action       receives court approval, the agreement is expected to reduce our OPEB obligation       by about $5 billion, with projected average annual cost savings of about       $650 million and reduced average annual cash outlays of about       $200 million.  Capacity       and Personnel Reductions.       Our       North American operations presently have the capacity to support a U.S. market       share significantly in excess of the 17% share our Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury       brands achieved in 2005. As a result, our plant utilization rate in North       America has been about 75%, which is not sustainable. Given the continued       proliferation of new model offerings by current and potential participants       in       the U.S. automotive market, we recognize the need to match our North American       production capacity to realistic volume and market share expectations.       Accordingly, we plan to idle and cease operations at 14 manufacturing       facilities in North America by 2012, including seven vehicle assembly plants.       Associated with these plant idlings, we intend to reduce our manufacturing       employment by 25,000 to 30,000 people during the same period. These personnel       reductions do not include actions at ACH, and are in addition to the previously       announced reduction of the equivalent of 4,000 salaried positions by the end       of       the first quarter of 2006, as well as a reduction in our officer ranks by 12       percent by the end of the first quarter of 2006.   The       first       facility to be idled pursuant to the Way Forward plan will be our St. Louis       Assembly Plant, which is targeted to cease production by the end of the first       quarter of 2006. Further, we have announced plans to idle the following       facilities through 2008: Atlanta Assembly Plant, Wixom Assembly Plant, Batavia       Transmission Plant, Windsor Casting Plant, and two additional assembly plants       to       be determined later this year. In addition, production at our St. Thomas       Assembly Plant will be reduced to one shift. These          34        ITEM             7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results             of             Operations (continued)     actions       should reduce our North American assembly capacity by 1.2 million units or       26% and help improve our assembly capacity utilization rate.

FULL-YEAR       2005 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Our       worldwide net income was $2.0 billion or $1.05 per share of Common and Class       B       stock in 2005, down $1.5 billion from a profit of $3.5 billion or $1.73 per       share in 2004.

Overall       Automotive Sector  The       decline in results reflected losses at our Ford North America business unit,       an       impairment charge for long-lived assets of Jaguar/Land Rover operations, and       higher charges for personnel reduction programs, offset partially by more       favorable market performance at Land Rover and improved results of our Ford       South America business unit, Other Automotive, and Ford Asia Pacific and       Africa/Mazda segment.

The       Americas Segment  Ford       North America.       The       decline in results primarily reflected unfavorable cost performance, lower       U.S.       market share, lower dealer stock levels, charges for personnel-reduction       programs, and unfavorable currency exchange. Unfavorable cost performance       primarily reflected higher warranty and material costs.   Ford       South America.

Ford       Europe and PAG Segment  Ford       Europe. The       decline in results primarily reflected higher charges for personnel-reduction       programs, negative net pricing, and adverse product and market mix, offset       partially by favorable cost performance and exchange.         37        ITEM             7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results             of             Operations (continued)      PAG.       The       decline in results primarily reflected an impairment charge for long-lived       assets of the Jaguar/Land Rover operations, unfavorable currency exchange,       and       higher charges for personnel-reduction programs, offset partially by favorable       net pricing, improved product mix primarily reflecting the impact of new Land       Rover products, and favorable cost performance. For additional discussion of       the       impairment charge, see Note 9 of the Notes to the Financial       Statements.  Ford       Asia Pacific and Africa/Mazda Segment  Ford       Asia Pacific and Africa. The       improvement in earnings primarily reflected the non-recurrence of 2004 charges       related to the disposition of certain dealerships, favorable changes in exchange       rates, and a gain on the disposal of our investment in Mahindra & Mahindra       Ltd., offset partially by unfavorable product mix, higher costs associated       with       new products and facilities in China and charges for personnel-reduction       programs.  Mazda       and Associated Operations. The       increase in earnings primarily reflected gains on our investment in Mazda       convertible bonds and improved Mazda operating results. In the second half       of       2005, we converted to equity about 82.5% of our Mazda convertible bonds, and,       therefore, expect diminished income effects in future periods from       mark-to-market adjustments for these bonds.  Other       Automotive   The       improvement primarily reflected higher returns on invested cash and a gain       on       the sale of non-core businesses, offset partially by lower interest on tax       refunds from prior-year federal and state tax matters (about $450 million       in 2005 compared with $600 million in 2004).  2004       Compared with 2003  Details       by Automotive business unit of Income/(loss)       before income taxes are       shown       below (in millions):              Income/(Loss)                 Before Income                 Taxes                     2004         2003     2004 Over/(Under) 2003       The                 Americas                         —                 Ford North America     $   684     $   196     $   488       —                 Ford South America       140       (129   )     269       Total                 The Americas       824       67       757       Ford                 Europe and PAG                         —                 Ford Europe       65       (1,620   )     1,685       —                 PAG       (850   )     171       (1,021   )     Total                 Ford Europe and PAG       (785   )     (1,449   )     664       Ford                 Asia Pacific and Africa/Mazda                         —                 Ford Asia Pacific and Africa       (36   )     (23   )     (13   )     —                 Mazda and Associated Operations       118       69       49       Total                 Ford Asia Pacific and Africa/Mazda       82       46       36       Other                 Automotive       (276   )     (572   )     296       Total                 Automotive sector     $   (155   )   $   (1,908   )   $   1,753                38        ITEM             7.

Overall       Automotive Sector  The       improvement in Income/(loss)       before income taxes primarily       reflected lower Visteon-related charges, higher net pricing, favorable cost       performance and the favorable effect of tax-related interest on refunds and       settlements of prior-year federal and state audits, offset partially by lower       vehicle unit sales and unfavorable changes in currency exchange       rates.  The       Americas Segment  Ford       North America. The       improvement in earnings primarily reflected the non-recurrence of $1.6 billion       of charges in 2003 related to Visteon, offset by a charge of $600 million       to establish an allowance against a receivable from Visteon in 2004.   In       addition, the improvement in earnings reflected positive net pricing and       favorable cost performance, offset partially by lower vehicle unit sales,       unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates (primarily weakening of the       U.S.       dollar compared with the Euro and the Canadian dollar) and a charge of       $182 million related to our investment in Ballard Power Systems Inc., a       provider of fuel-cell technology.          39        ITEM             7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results             of             Operations (continued)      Ford       South America. The       improvement in earnings primarily reflected positive net pricing and higher       vehicle unit sales, offset partially by higher commodity costs.  Ford       Europe and PAG Segment  Ford       Europe. The       improvement in earnings primarily reflected favorable cost performance, lower       charges related to the Ford Europe Improvement Plan (primarily employee       separation charges) and higher profits at our Ford Otosan joint venture in       Turkey.   PAG.       The       increased loss primarily reflected unfavorable changes in currency exchange       rates, as well as vehicle production reductions and employee separation charges       at Jaguar related to the implementation of the PAG Improvement Plan and higher       costs for launching new vehicles, offset partially by positive net       pricing.  Ford       Asia Pacific and Africa/Mazda Segment  Ford       Asia Pacific and Africa. The       decline in earnings reflected a charge related to the disposition of certain       dealerships, offset partially by favorable changes in exchange rates and higher       vehicle unit sales.  Mazda       and Associated Operations. The       change primarily reflected improvements in our Mazda-related       investments.  Other       Automotive  The       improvement in results primarily reflected higher tax-related interest on refund       claims and the favorable effect on interest expense of the settlements in 2004       of prior-year federal and state tax audits and 2004 debt repurchases. This       was       offset partially by the reclassification of interest expense on our 6.50% Junior       Subordinated Debentures due 2032 held by a subsidiary trust, Ford Motor Company       Capital Trust II.

(b) The       segment presentation of the gain on sale of Hertz in Note 24 of the Notes to       the       Financial Statements is $1,006 million in the Hertz segment and $89 million       in       Other Financial             Services.  Ford       Credit  Ford       Credit's income before income taxes was down $570 million. The decrease in       earnings primarily reflected higher borrowing costs and the impact of lower       retail receivable levels, offset partially by improved credit loss       performance.  Ford       Credit reviews its business performance from several perspectives,       including:  • On-balance       sheet basis.       Includes the receivables Ford Credit owns and receivables sold for legal       purposes that remain on Ford Credit’s balance sheet;         40        ITEM             7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results             of             Operations (continued)     • Securitized       off-balance sheet basis.       Includes receivables sold in securitization transactions that are not reflected       on Ford Credit’s balance sheet;  • Managed       basis.       Includes on-balance sheet and securitized off-balance sheet receivables that       Ford Credit continues to service; and  • Serviced       basis.       Includes managed receivables and receivables sold in whole-loan sale       transactions where Ford Credit retains no interest in the sold receivables,       but       which it continues to service.  Ford       Credit analyzes its financial performance primarily on an on-balance sheet       and       managed basis. It retains interests in receivables sold in off-balance sheet       securitizations and, with respect to subordinated retained interests, has credit       risk. As a result, it evaluates credit losses, receivables and leverage on       a       managed basis as well as on an on-balance sheet basis. In contrast, Ford Credit       does not have the same financial interest in the performance of receivables       sold       in whole-loan sale transactions, and as a result, Ford Credit generally reviews       the performance of its serviced portfolio only to evaluate the effectiveness       of       its origination and collection activities. To evaluate the performance of these       activities, Ford Credit monitors a number of measures, such as repossession       statistics, losses on repossessions and the number of bankruptcy       filings.  Ford       Credit’s operating results are impacted significantly by the level of its       receivables, which are shown below (in billions):            December                 31,             2005     2004       On-Balance                 Sheet (including on-balance sheet                 securitizations)                   Finance                 receivables                   Retail                 installment     $   65.7     $   81.7       Wholesale       39.6       23.8       Other       4.6       5.3       Total                 finance receivables, net       109.9       110.8       Net                 investment in operating leases       22.2       21.9       Total                 on-balance sheet*     $   132.1     $   132.7       Memo:                 Allowance for credit losses included above     $   1.6     $   2.4       Securitized                 Off-Balance Sheet                   Finance                 receivables                   Retail                 installment     $   18.0     $   16.7       Wholesale       —       18.9       Other       —       —       Total                 finance receivables       18.0       35.6       Net                 investment in operating leases       —       —       Total                 securitized off-balance sheet     $   18.0     $   35.6       Managed                   Finance                 receivables                   Retail                 installment     $   83.7     $   98.4       Wholesale       39.6       42.7       Other       4.6       5.3       Total                 finance receivables, net       127.9       146.4       Net                 investment in operating leases       22.2       21.9       Total                 managed     $   150.1     $   168.3       Serviced     $   153.0     $   172.3       __________ *        At       December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, finance receivables of $44.7 billion       and $16.9 billion, respectively, have been sold for legal purposes to       consolidated securitization special purpose entities ("SPEs"). In addition,       at       December 31, 2005, and December 31, 2004, interests in operating leases and       the       related vehicles of $6.5 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, have been       transferred for legal purposes to consolidated securitization SPEs. These       receivables and interests in operating leases and the related vehicles are       available only for repayment of debt issued by those entities, and to pay other       securitization investors and other participants; they are not available to       pay       Ford Credit’s other obligations or the claims of Ford Credit’s other       creditors.  On-Balance       Sheet Receivables. On-balance       sheet receivables decreased from year-end 2004 primarily reflecting lower retail       contract placement volumes. The decrease was largely offset by the accounting       consolidation of Ford Credit's off-balance sheet wholesale securitization       program as a result of certain changes made to the program in the fourth quarter       of 2005, which caused the receivables previously sold by Ford Credit to this       program to be reported on-balance sheet.  Securitized       Off-Balance Sheet Receivables. Total       securitized off-balance sheet receivables declined primarily reflecting the       accounting consolidation discussed above.  Managed       and serviced receivables decreased from year-end 2004 primarily reflecting       lower       retail contract placement volumes.          41        ITEM             7.

Charge-offs       and loss-to-receivable ratios for Ford Credit's on-balance sheet, securitized       off-balance sheet and managed portfolios declined from a year ago, primarily       reflecting fewer repossessions and a lower average loss per repossession. These       improvements resulted from a higher-quality retail installment and lease       portfolio, higher used vehicle prices and enhancements to Ford Credit's       collection practices. Lower levels of retail installment receivables also       contributed to reduced charge-offs.  Shown       below is an analysis of Ford Credit’s allowance for credit losses related to       finance receivables and operating leases for the years ended December 31 (dollar       amounts in billions):            2005     2004       AlAllowance                 for Credit Losses                   Balance,                 beginning of year     $   2.4     $   2.9       Provision                 for credit losses       0.2       0.9       Deductions                   Charge-offs       1.2       1.8       Recoveries       (0.5   )     (0.5   )     Net                 charge-offs       0.7       1.3       Other                 changes, principally amounts related to finance receivables sold                 and                 translation adjustments       0.3       0.1       Net                 deductions       1.0       1.4       Balance,                 end of year     $   1.6     $   2.4       Allowance                 for credit losses as a percentage of end-of-period net                 receivables       1.19   %     1.80   %      The       allowance for credit losses decreased about $800 million from year-end 2004,       primarily reflecting improved charge-off performance and the effect of lower       retail receivable levels.   Hertz       Operating Results  The       improvement in Hertz operating results primarily reflected the cessation of       depreciation on long-lived assets from the point Hertz was held for sale (i.e.,       September 2005) until it was sold, higher car and equipment rental volumes       and       improved pricing for equipment rental.         42        ITEM             7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results             of             Operations (continued)     Other       Financial Services Operating Results  The       decrease in earnings primarily reflected the non-recurrence of a 2004 property       clean-up settlement, and, in 2005, lower property sales and the write-off of       aircraft leases related to the bankruptcy of Delta Air Lines.  2004       Compared with 2003  Details       of the full-year Financial Services sector Income/(loss)       before income taxes for       2004       and 2003 are shown below (in millions):              Income/(Loss) Before                 Income Taxes                     2004         2003     2004 Over/(Under) 2003       Ford                 Credit     $   4,431     $   2,956     $   1,475       Hertz*       493       228       265       Other                 Financial Services       84       63       21       Total                 Financial Services sector     $   5,008     $   3,247     $   1,761       __________ * Includes       amortization expense related to intangibles recognized upon consolidation of       Hertz.  Ford       Credit  The       increase in income before income taxes primarily reflected improved credit       loss       performance and improved leasing results. The improved credit loss performance       primarily resulted from fewer repossessions and a lower average loss per       repossession. The improvement in leasing results primarily reflected higher       used       vehicle prices and a reduction in the percentage of vehicles returned to Ford       Credit at lease termination.  Hertz  The       improvement in earnings primarily reflected higher vehicle and equipment rental       volumes, lower fleet costs and higher proceeds received in excess of book value       on the disposal of used vehicle and equipment, offset partially by lower       pricing.  LIQUIDITY       AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Automotive       Sector  Our       strategy is to ensure we have sufficient funding available with a high degree       of       certainty throughout the business cycle. The key elements of this strategy       include maintaining large gross cash balances, generating cash from       operating-related activities, having a long-dated debt maturity profile,       maintaining committed credit facilities and funding long-term liabilities over       time.  Gross       Cash. Automotive       gross cash includes cash and cash equivalents, marketable and loaned securities       and assets contained in a short-term Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association       trust ("VEBA"), a trust which may be used to pre-fund certain types of company       paid benefits for U.S. employees and retirees. Gross cash as of       December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is detailed below (in       billions):            December                 31,             2005     2004     2003       Cash                 and cash equivalents     $   13.4     $   10.1     $   6.9       Marketable                 securities       6.9       8.3       9.3       Loaned                 securities*       3.4       1.1       5.7       Total                 cash, marketable securities and loaned securities       23.7       19.5       21.9       Short-term                 VEBA assets       1.4       4.1       4.0       Gross                 cash     $   25.1     $   23.6     $   25.9       __________ * As       part       of our investment strategy, we engage in securities lending to improve the       returns on our cash portfolios. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Financial       Statements for additional          discussion on securities lending.  In       managing our business, we classify changes in Automotive gross cash into two       categories: operating-related and other (which primarily includes pension and       long-term VEBA contributions, tax refunds, capital transactions with the       Financial Services sector, and acquisitions and divestitures). Our key metric       is       operating-related cash flow, which best represents the ability of our Automotive                43        ITEM             7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results             of             Operations (continued)     operations       to generate cash. We believe the cash flow analysis reflected in the table       below, which differs from a cash flow statement presented in accordance with       generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"),       is       useful to investors because it includes cash flow elements that we consider       to       be related to our operating activities (e.g., capital spending) that are not       included in Net       cash flows from operating activities,       the       most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure.

At       December 31, 2005, our Automotive sector had total debt of $17.9       billion, compared with $18.4 billion a year ago. Total senior debt at       December 31, 2005 was $12.7 billion, compared with       $13.1 billion at December 31, 2004. The decrease in senior debt       primarily reflected repurchases of debt securities in the open market. Ford       Motor Company Capital Trust II had outstanding $5.0 billion of trust       preferred securities at December 31, 2005 and 2004.         44        ITEM             7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results             of             Operations (continued)     At       December 31, 2005, our Automotive sector had net cash (defined as gross cash       less total senior and subordinated debt) of $7.2 billion, compared with       $5.2 billion at the end of 2004.  The       weighted-average maturity of our total long-term debt (including subordinated       debt), substantially all of which is fixed-rate debt, is approximately 25 years       with $4.3 billion maturing by December 31, 2025. The weighted-average maturity       of total debt (long-term and short-term including subordinated debt) is       approximately 25 years.

In       July       2005, we raised $2.0 billion of seasonal working capital funding to reduce       the       cash volatility that results from our summer plant shutdown period. The funding       was in the form of 60-day bank loans which were repaid in early September.         Credit       Facilities. At       December 31, 2005, the Automotive sector had $7.1 billion of contractually       committed credit facilities with financial institutions, of which $6.9 billion       were available for use. For further discussion of our committed credit       facilities, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.  Pension       Plan Contributions. In       2005,       U.S. pension funding reform proposals were passed in both the House of       Representatives and the Senate. Although a final bill has not yet been       completed, it is likely that a final bill will be passed and signed into law       in       2006. It is anticipated that this law would institute more stringent funding       requirements for U.S. defined benefit pension plans beginning in 2007. U.K.       pension reform was passed in November 2004, and could affect funding       requirements beginning in 2007. For a discussion of pension plan contributions       we have made in 2005 and expect to make in 2006, see Note 23 of the Notes to       the       Financial Statements.  Financial       Services Sector  Ford       Credit  Ford       Credit's funding strategy is to maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding       sources that are cost effective. As a result of lower credit ratings, Ford       Credit's unsecured borrowing costs have increased, its access to the unsecured       debt market has become more restricted, and its outstanding short- and long-term       unsecured debt balances have declined. In response, Ford Credit has increased       its use of securitization and other asset-related sources of liquidity, and       will       continue to expand and diversify its asset-backed funding by asset class, region       and channel. In addition, Ford Credit will continue to participate in the       whole-loan market and access the unsecured term-debt market opportunistically.       Over time, Ford Credit may also need to reduce further the amount of receivables       it purchases. A significant reduction in the amount of purchased receivables       would significantly reduce Ford Credit's ongoing profits, and could adversely       affect its ability to support the sale of our vehicles.  Debt       and Cash.       Ford       Credit’s total debt was $134.5 billion at December 31, 2005, down $9.8 billion       compared with a year ago, primarily reflecting repayment of maturing debt and       lower funding requirements due to lower asset levels. Ford Credit’s outstanding       unsecured commercial paper at December 31, 2005 totaled $1.0 billion, down       $7.9       billion compared with a year ago, reflecting decreased investor       demand.  At       December 31, 2005, Ford Credit had cash and cash equivalents of $17.9 billion,       compared with $12.7 billion at year-end 2004. In the normal course of its       funding activities, Ford Credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary       for its immediate funding needs. These excess amounts are maintained primarily       as highly liquid investments, which provide liquidity for Ford Credit’s       short-term funding needs and give Ford Credit flexibility in the use of its       other funding programs.  Funding.       Ford       Credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business. Ford       Credit’s funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to: (i) purchase       retail installment sale contracts and retail lease contracts to support the       sale       of Ford products, which are influenced by Ford-sponsored special financing       programs that are available exclusively through Ford Credit, (ii) provide       wholesale financing and capital financing for Ford dealers, and (iii) repay       its       debt obligations.  Ford       Credit’s funding sources include sales of receivables in securitizations and       other structured financings, unsecured debt issuances and bank borrowings.       Unsecured debt issuance consists of short- and long-term unsecured debt, placed       directly by Ford Credit or through securities dealers or underwriters in U.S.       and international capital markets, and reaches both retail and institutional       investors. During 2005, Ford Credit continued to meet a significant portion       of       its funding requirements through securitizations because of their lower relative       costs given our credit ratings (as described below), the stability of the market       for asset-backed securities, and the          45        ITEM             7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results             of             Operations (continued)     diversity       of funding sources that they provide. Securitized funding (both on- and       off-balance sheet, net of retained interests) as a percent of total managed       receivables was as follows at the end of each of the last three years: 2005       -       38%, 2004 - 26%, 2003 - 25%.  Ford       Credit issues unsecured commercial paper in the United States, Europe and other       international markets, with sales mostly to qualified institutional investors.       In addition to its commercial paper programs, Ford Credit also obtains       short-term funding from the sale of floating rate demand notes under a program       referred to as Ford Interest Advantage, and such notes may be redeemed at any       time at the option of the holder thereof without restriction. At December 31,       2005, the principal amount outstanding of such notes was $6.7 billion. Ford       Credit does not hold reserves to fund the payment of the demand notes or any       other short-term funding obligation. Ford Credit’s policy is to have sufficient       cash and cash equivalents, unused committed bank-sponsored asset-backed       commercial paper issuer ("conduit") capacity, securitizable assets, and back-up       credit facilities to provide liquidity for all of its short-term funding       obligations.  The       following table illustrates Ford Credit’s term public funding issuances for 2004       and 2005 and its planned issuances for 2006 (in billions):              2006 Forecast       2005       2004       Unsecured                 Term Debt                         Institutional     $   0                 - 2     $   8     $   7       Retail       0                 - 1       1       5       Total                 unsecured term debt       0                 - 3       9       12       Term                 Public Securitization                 (a)       8                 - 12       12       6       Total                 term public funding     $   8                 - 15     $   21     $   18       Memo                 - Not Included Above                         Private                 transactions (b)      $   25                 - 35     $   18     $   10                               __________ (a) Reflects       new issuance and includes funding from discontinued operations in 2004; excludes       whole-loan sales and other structured financings. (b) Includes       private securitizations, other structured financings and whole-loan sales;       excludes sales to Ford Credit's on-balance sheet asset-backed commercial paper       programs and             proceeds from revolving transactions.  The       cost       of both debt and funding in securitizations is based on a margin or spread       over       a benchmark interest rate, such as interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury       securities of similar maturities. Ford Credit's unsecured spreads have been       very       volatile over the last three years, as a result of market perception and its       lower credit ratings, whereas its securitized funding spreads (which are based       on the underlying finance receivables and credit enhancements) have not. In       2005, Ford Credit's unsecured long-term debt funding spreads fluctuated between       165 and 660 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasury securities, while its       spreads on securitized funding fluctuated between 42 and 58 basis points above       comparable U.S. Treasury securities.  Ford       Credit has a program to sell retail installment sale contracts in transactions       where it retains no interest and thus no exposure to the sold assets. These       transactions, referred to as "whole-loan sale transactions," provide liquidity       by enabling Ford Credit to reduce its managed receivables and its need for       funding to support those receivables. In 2005, Ford Credit sold $1.5 billion       of       receivables in a whole-loan sale transaction. Total outstanding receivables       sold       in whole-loan sale transactions at December 31, 2005 were       $2.9 billion.  For       additional funding and to maintain liquidity, Ford Credit and its majority-owned       subsidiaries, including FCE Bank plc ("FCE"), have contractually committed       credit facilities with financial institutions that totaled $6.2 billion at       December 31, 2005, of which $5.1 billion were available for use. Of the       lines available for use, 36% are committed through June 30, 2010. Of the       $6.2 billion, $3.8 billion constitute Ford Credit facilities ($3.2       billion global and about $600 million non-global) and $2.4 billion constitute       FCE facilities ($2.3 billion global and about $100 million non-global). In       addition, at December 31, 2005, banks provided $18.7 billion of       contractually committed liquidity facilities exclusively to support Ford       Credit's two on-balance sheet asset-backed commercial paper programs;       $18.2 billion supported Ford Credit's FCAR retail program and $500 million       supported Ford Credit's wholesale securitization program ("Motown Notes").       Ford       Credit also has entered into agreements with several bank-sponsored conduits       under which such conduits are contractually committed to purchase from Ford       Credit, at Ford Credit’s option, retail receivables for proceeds of up to       approximately $16.2 billion. At December 31, 2005, $5.5 billion of these       conduit commitments were in use. For further discussion of these facilities       and       agreements, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.         46        ITEM             7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results             of             Operations (continued)     Leverage.       Ford       Credit uses leverage, or the debt-to-equity ratio, to make various business       decisions, including establishing pricing for retail, wholesale and lease       financing and assessing its capital structure. Ford Credit calculates leverage       on a financial statement basis and on a managed basis using the following       formulas:      Financial                 Statement Leverage   =    Total                 Debt                               Equity                           Total                 Debt   +   Securitized Off-Balance Sheet Receivables   -   Retained Interest                 in Securitized Off-Balance Sheet Receivables                           -   Cash and                 Cash  Equivalents                       -   Fair                 Value Hedge Accounting Adjustments on                 Total Debt     Managed                 Leverage   =                                               Equity                                                   +   Minority Interest   -   Fair                 Value Hedge Accounting Adjustments on                 Equity          The       following table illustrates the calculation of Ford Credit’s financial statement       leverage (in billions, except for ratios):            December                 31,             2005     2004     2003       Total                 debt     $   134.5     $   144.3     $   149.7       Total                 stockholder’s equity       10.7       11.5       12.5       Debt-to-equity                 ratio (to 1)       12.5       12.6       12.0        The       following table illustrates the calculation of Ford Credit’s managed leverage       (in billions, except for ratios):            December                 31,             2005     2004     2003       Total                 debt     $   134.5     $   144.3     $   149.7       Securitized                 off-balance sheet receivables outstanding (a)       18.0       37.7       49.4                        Retained                 interest in securitized off-balance sheet receivables (b)       (1.4   )     (9.5   )     (13.0   )     Adjustments                 for cash and cash equivalents       (17.9   )     (12.7   )     (15.7   )     Fair                 value hedge accounting adjustments       (1.6   )     (3.2   )     (4.7   )     Total                 adjusted debt     $   131.6     $   156.6     $   165.7       Total                 stockholder’s equity (including minority interest)     $   10.7     $   11.5     $   12.5       Fair                 value hedge accounting adjustments        —          (0.1   )     0.2       Total                 adjusted equity     $   10.7     $   11.4     $   12.7       Managed                 debt-to-equity ratio (to 1)       12.3       13.7       13.0       __________     (a)   Includes                 securitized funding from discontinued operations in 2003 and                 2004.     (b)   Includes                 retained interest in securitized receivables from discontinued operations                 in 2003 and 2004.      Ford       Credit believes that managed leverage is useful to its investors because it       reflects the way Ford Credit manages its business. Ford Credit retains interests       in receivables sold in off-balance sheet securitization transactions and, with       respect to subordinated retained interests, is exposed to credit risk.       Accordingly, Ford Credit considers securitization as an alternative source       of       funding and evaluates charge-offs, receivables and leverage on a managed as       well       as a financial statement basis. Ford Credit also deducts cash and cash       equivalents because they generally correspond to excess debt beyond the amount       required to support its operations. In addition, Ford Credit adds its minority       interests to its financial statement equity because all of the debt of such       consolidated entities is included in its total debt. Ford Credit makes fair       value hedge accounting adjustments to its assets, debt and equity positions       to       reflect the impact of interest rate instruments Ford Credit uses in connection       with its term-debt issuances and securitizations. The fair value hedge       accounting adjustments vary over the term of the underlying debt and securitized       funding obligations based on changes in market interest rates. Ford Credit       generally repays its debt obligations as they mature. As a result, Ford Credit       excludes the impact of the fair value hedge accounting adjustments on both       the       numerator and denominator in order to exclude the interim effects of changes       in       market interest rates. Accordingly, the managed leverage measure provides Ford       Credit’s investors with meaningful information regarding management’s       decision-making processes.   Ford       Credit's managed leverage strategy involves establishing a leverage level that       takes into consideration prevailing market conditions and reflects the risk       characteristics of its business. At December 31, 2005, Ford Credit's managed       leverage was 12.3 to 1, compared with 13.7 to 1 a year ago. Ford       Credit plans to continue to reduce its managed leverage in 2006. In 2005,       Ford Credit paid cash dividends of $2.75 billion.          47        ITEM             7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results             of             Operations (continued)     Total       Company  Stockholders'       Equity. Our       stockholders' equity was $13.0 billion at December 31, 2005, down $3.1 billion       compared with December 31, 2004. The decrease primarily reflected       foreign currency translation adjustments, net losses on derivative instruments,       and cash dividends, offset partially by net income. For additional discussion       of       foreign currency translation adjustments and derivative instruments, see Notes       1       and 20, respectively, of the Notes to the Financial Statements.  Credit       Ratings. Our       short- and long-term debt is rated by four credit rating agencies designated       as       nationally recognized statistical rating organizations ("NRSROs") by the       Securities and Exchange Commission:  • Dominion       Bond Rating Service Limited ("DBRS");   • Fitch,       Inc. ("Fitch");   • Moody’s       Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's"); and   • Standard       & Poor’s Rating Services, a division of McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.       ("S&P").  In       several markets, locally recognized rating agencies also rate us. A credit       rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit risk associated       with particular securities we issue, based on information provided by us and       other sources. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold       securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the       assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria for       evaluating company risk, and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently       for each rating agency. Lower credit ratings generally result in higher       borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. The NRSROs have indicated       that our lower ratings are primarily a reflection of the rating agencies'       concerns regarding our automotive cash flow and profitability, declining market       share, excess industry capacity, industry pricing pressure and rising health       care costs.  Ford.       In       December 2005, Fitch lowered Ford's long-term rating to BB+ from BBB-, lowered       our short-term rating to B from F2 and maintained our outlook at Negative.       In       January 2006, S&P lowered our long-term rating to BB- from BB+, lowered our       short-term rating to B-2 from B-1 and maintained our outlook at Negative. In       January 2006, Moody's lowered our long-term rating to Ba3 from Ba1 and       maintained our outlook at Negative. In January 2006, DBRS lowered our long-term       rating to BB (low) from BB (high), affirmed our short-term rating at       R-3 (high) and maintained our trend at Negative.   Ford       Credit.       In       December 2005, Fitch lowered Ford       Credit's       long-term rating to BB+ from BBB-, lowered Ford Credit's short-term rating       to B       from F2 and maintained Ford Credit's outlook at Negative. In January 2006,       S&P lowered Ford Credit's long-term rating to BB- from BB+, lowered Ford       Credit's short-term debt rating to B-2 from B-1 and maintained Ford Credit's       outlook at Negative. In January 2006, Moody's lowered Ford Credit's long-term       rating to Ba2 from Baa3, lowered Ford Credit's short-term rating to Not Prime       ("NP") from P3 and maintained Ford Credit's outlook at Negative. In January       2006, DBRS lowered Ford Credit's long-term rating to BB from BBB (low), lowered       Ford Credit's short-term rating to R-3 (high) from R-2 (low) and maintained       Ford       Credit's trend at Negative.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results             of             Operations (continued)     OUTLOOK  We       have       set and communicated the following planning assumptions and operational       metrics:      Industry                 Volume (SAAR                 incl. heavy trucks)     Planning                 Assumptions     U.S.                      17.0                 million units     Europe                      17.3                 million units             Industry                 Net Pricing         U.S                      Slightly                 negative     Europe                      Slightly                 negative             Operation                 Metrics     2006                 Milestones     Quality                                     Improved     Market                 share                                     Flat to improved     Automotive                 cost performance*                                     Favorable     Capital                 spending                                     About $7 billion     __________ * At       constant volume, mix and exchange; excluding special items.  Automotive       Cost Performance. We       expect       commodity costs to continue to increase in 2006. We also expect depreciation       and       amortization expenses to increase in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily because       capacity reduction actions pursuant to our Way Forward plan will result in       accelerated depreciation of assets at certain manufacturing facilities. We       expect our quality-related costs in 2006 to be about the same as in 2005;       although we expect favorable performance in our vehicle quality, we will not       have the recurrence of the favorable impact of a $240 million settlement reached       in 2005 with Bridgestone-Firestone North American Tire, LLC. Pension and OPEB       expenses in 2006 also are expected to be about the same as last year, with       the       modifications to retiree health care programs (discussed above under "Overview")       offsetting the impact of these expenses for our employees previously assigned       to       Visteon, as well as lower discount rates and lower assumed rates of return.       Manufacturing, engineering and overhead costs are expected to be lower in 2006,       reflecting personnel reductions and other efficiencies. Product costs are       expected to be favorable in 2006 compared with 2005, as we begin to see the       benefits of the material cost reduction plan discussed above under "Overview."       Overall, excluding special items and at constant volume, mix, and exchange,       we       expect our cost performance to be favorable in 2006, compared with       2005.  Automotive       Results. Our       automotive operations in North America are projected to post a pre-tax loss       in       2006. However, subject to the risks described below, we expect these operations       to be profitable no later than 2008, although the progression to profitability       will not necessarily be linear or smooth. Subject to the risks described below,       we expect each of our other automotive business units to be profitable on a       pre-tax basis in 2006. Overall, we expect our total automotive operations to       be       unprofitable in 2006 due to the expected performance of our North American       operations.  These       expected results include certain pre-tax charges (i.e., special items) of about       $1 billion that we anticipate in 2006. These charges will include the costs       associated with the Way Forward plan through 2006, which are estimated to       include pre-tax charges and cash expenditures of $250 million for hourly       personnel reductions, and pre-tax charges (primarily non-cash) of       $250 million for fixed asset write-offs. The remainder of these charges       relates to personnel reduction actions in Europe and, to a lesser extent, at       our       ACH operations.  In       addition, in connection with the Way Forward plan, we are reviewing costs       relating to the guaranteed employment numbers ("GEN") provision of our       collective bargaining agreement with the UAW. Under this GEN provision, we       are       required to pay idled workers who meet certain conditions substantially all       of       their wages and benefits for the term of the current agreement. Heretofore,       we       have had relatively few employees subject to the GEN provision; however, we       expect the number of employees subject to the GEN provision to grow in the       near       term as a result of the hourly personnel reduction actions that are part of       the       Way Forward plan. We are presently assessing the appropriate accounting       treatment for and amount of these GEN costs, including the extent, if any,       to       which future GEN costs should be accrued in the first quarter of       2006.  Financial       Services Results. Our       Financial Services sector is projected to be profitable in 2006, but less       profitable than in 2005 because of the absence of earnings from Hertz (including       the gain on sale) and lower expected earnings at Ford Credit. For 2006, we       expect Ford Credit's managed receivables to decline to between $140 billion       and $145 billion. Ford Credit's 2006 earnings are expected to be lower than       in 2005 because of the impact of the lower level of receivables and the impact       of higher interest rates.          49        ITEM             7.

For additional discussion of       these risks, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors."   CRITICAL       ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  We       consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 1) the accounting estimate       requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at       the       time the accounting estimate was made, and 2) changes in the estimate that       are       reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates       that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material       impact on our financial condition or results of operations.         50        ITEM             7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results             of             Operations (continued)      Management       has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting       estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. In addition,       there       are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but       are       not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and       other items could have a material impact on our financial       statements.  Warranty       and Additional Service Actions  Nature       of Estimates Required. The       estimated warranty and additional service action costs are accrued for each       vehicle at the time of sale. Estimates are principally based on assumptions       regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each vehicle line and each model year       of that vehicle line, where little or no claims experience may exist. In       addition, the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to       be       approved, and policies related to additional service actions, are taken into       consideration. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these       estimated factors, changes in our assumptions could materially affect net       income.  Assumptions       and Approach Used. Our       estimate of warranty and additional service action obligations is reevaluated       on       a quarterly basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model       year can be volatile; therefore, our process relies upon long-term historical       averages until sufficient data are available. As actual experience becomes       available, it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the       forecast is within the range of likely outcomes. Resulting balances are then       compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate       to       meet expected future obligations.  See       Note       27 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding       costs       and assumptions for warranties and additional service actions.  Pensions  Nature       of Estimates Required.       The       estimation of our pension obligations, costs and liabilities requires that       we       make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments       to       all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future       events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions       may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions.   Assumptions       and Approach Used.       The       assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following       key       factors:     ·    Discount                 rates         ·    Salary                 growth         ·    Retirement                 rates         ·    Expected                 contributions         ·    Inflation         ·    Expected                 return on plan assets         ·    Mortality                 rates      We       base       the discount rate assumption primarily on the results of a cash flow matching       analysis, which matches the future cash outflows for each major plan to a yield       curve comprised of high quality bonds specific to the country of the plan.       Our       inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators.       The salary growth assumption reflects our long-term actual experience, the       near-term outlook, and assumed inflation. The expected return on plan assets       assumption reflects historical plan returns and long-run inputs from a range       of       internal and external advisors for capital market returns, inflation, bond       yields, and other variables, adjusted for specific aspects of our investment       strategy. We also consider peer data in setting the expected return on asset       assumption. The expected amount and timing of contributions is based on an       assessment of minimum requirements, and additional amounts based on cash       availability and other considerations (e.g., funded status, avoidance of Pension       Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") penalty premiums, U.K. Pension Protection       Fund levies, and tax efficiency). Retirement and mortality rates are developed       to reflect actual and projected plan experience. Plan obligations and costs       are       based on existing retirement plan provisions. No assumption is made regarding       any potential future changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we       are       presently committed (e.g., in existing labor contracts). The effects of actual       results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions       are included in unamortized net gains and losses. Unamortized gains and losses       are amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our       recognized expense in future periods.         51        ITEM             7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results             of             Operations (continued)      See       Note       23 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding       costs       and assumptions for employee retirement benefits.  Sensitivity       Analysis.       The       December 31, 2005 funded status of our pension plans is affected by       December 31, 2005 assumptions. Pension expense for 2005 is based on       the plan design and assumptions as of December 31, 2004. Note that       these sensitivities may be asymmetric, and are specific to 2005. They also       may       not be additive, so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously       cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown. The effect       of the indicated increase/(decrease) in selected factors is shown below (in       millions):              Increase/(Decrease)                 in:           Percentage     December                 31, 2005                 Point     U.S.                 Plans     Non-U.S.                 Plans         2005                 Expense       Assumption     Change     Funded                 Status     Funded                 Status     Equity     U.S.                 Plans     Non-U.S.                 Plans       Discount                 rate       +/-                 1.0 pt.     $   4,690/$(5,250   )   $   4,280/$(5,310   )   $   3,450/$(6,560   )   $   (110)/$320     $   (330)/$430       Actual                 return on assets                                    +/- 1.0       390/(390   )     180/(180   )     1,400/(200   )     —       —       Expected                 return on assets                                    +/- 1.0       —       —       —       (380)/380       (150)/150        The       foregoing indicates that changes in the discount rate and return on assets       can       have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans,       stockholders' equity and expense. We cannot predict these changes in discount       rates or investment returns and, therefore, cannot reasonably estimate whether       adjustments to our stockholders' equity for minimum pension liability in       subsequent years will be significant.  Other       Postretirement Employee Benefits (Retiree Health Care and Life       Insurance)  Nature       of Estimates Required.       The       estimation of our obligations, costs and liabilities associated with other       postretirement employee benefits ("OPEB") (i.e., retiree health care and life       insurance) requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the       projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the       likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases, salary       increases and demographic experience, which may have an effect on the amount       and       timing of future payments.  Assumptions       and Approach Used.       The       assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following       key       factors:     ·    Discount                 rates         ·    Salary                 growth         ·    Retirement                 rates         ·    Expected                 contributions         ·    Health                 care cost trends         ·    Expected                 return on plan assets         ·    Mortality                 rates      Our       health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data,       the near-term outlook, anticipated efficiencies and other cost-mitigation       actions (including eligibility management, employee education and wellness,       competitive sourcing and appropriate employee cost sharing) and an assessment       of       likely long-term trends. We base the discount rate assumption primarily on       the       results of a cash flow matching analysis, which matches the future cash outflows       for each plan to a yield curve comprised of high quality bonds specific to       the       country of the plan. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long-term actual       experience, the near-term outlook and assumed inflation. The expected return       on       plan assets assumption reflects historical plan returns and inputs from a range       of internal and external advisors for capital market returns, inflation, bond       yields, and other variables, adjusted for specific aspects of our investment       strategy. We also consider peer data in setting the expected return on asset       assumption. The expected amount and timing of contributions is based on an       assessment of cash availability and other considerations (e.g., funded status       and tax efficiency). Retirement and mortality rates are developed to reflect       actual and projected plan experience. Plan obligations and costs are based       on       existing retirement plan provisions. No assumption is made regarding any       potential future changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are       presently committed (e.g., in existing labor contracts). The effects of actual       results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions       are included in unamortized net gains and losses. Unamortized gains and losses       are amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our       recognized expense in future periods.         52        ITEM             7.

Sensitivity       Analysis.       The       December 31, 2005 OPEB obligation is affected by December 31, 2005 assumptions.       OPEB expense for 2005 is based on the plan design and assumptions as of December       31, 2004. Note that these sensitivities may be asymmetric, and are specific       to       2005. They are not additive, so the impact of changing multiple factors       simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities       shown. The effect of the indicated increase/(decrease) in selected assumptions       is shown below (in millions):                      Effect                 on U.S. and Canadian Plans: Increase/(Decrease)         Assumption     Percentage Point                 Change     December                 31, 2005 Obligation     2005 Expense       Discount                 rate       +/-                 1.0   pt.  $   (5,540)/$6,330     $   (460)/$530       Health                 care cost trend rates — total expense       +/-                 1.0       4,910/(3,890   )     830/(650   )     Health                 care cost trend rates — service and interest expense       +/-                 1.0       4,910/(3,890   )     490/(380   )      Allowance       for Credit Losses — Financial Services Sector  The       allowance for credit losses is Ford Credit's estimate of credit losses related       to impaired finance receivables and operating leases at the date of the       financial statements. Ford Credit monitors credit loss performance monthly       and       assesses the adequacy of its allowance for credit losses quarterly. Because       credit losses can vary substantially over time, estimating credit losses       requires a number of assumptions about matters that are uncertain.  Nature       of Estimates Required. Ford       Credit estimates the credit losses related to impaired finance receivables       and       operating leases by evaluating several factors including historical credit       loss       trends, the credit quality of its present portfolio, trends in historical and       projected used vehicle values and general economic measures.  Assumptions       Used. Ford       Credit makes projections of two key assumptions:  • Frequency.       The       number of finance receivables and operating lease contracts that it expects       will       default over a period of time, measured as repossessions; and  • Loss       severity. The       expected difference between the amount a customer owes Ford Credit when it       charges off the finance contract and the amount it receives, net of expenses,       from          selling the repossessed vehicle, including any recoveries from the       customer.  Ford       Credit uses these assumptions to assist in setting its allowance for credit       losses. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more       information regarding allowance for credit losses.   Sensitivity       Analysis. Changes       in the assumptions used to derive frequency and severity would affect the       allowance for credit losses. The effect of the indicated increase/decrease       in       the assumptions is shown below for Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles       in       the United States (in millions):                  Increase/(Decrease)           Assumption       Percentage Point                 Change     December                 31, 2005 Allowance                 for Credit                 Losses       2005 Expense       Repossession                 rates *       +/-                 0.1   pt.  $   40/$(40   )   $   40/$(40   )     Loss                 severity       +/-                 1.0       10/(10   )     10/(10   )     __________ * Reflects       the number of finance receivables and operating lease contracts that we expect       will default over a period of time relative to the average number of contracts       outstanding.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results             of             Operations (continued)      Accumulated       Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases  Accumulated       depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases reduces the value of the       leased vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition       value to their expected residual value at the end of the lease term. These       vehicles primarily consist of retail lease contracts for Ford Credit and       vehicles sold to daily rental car companies subject to a guaranteed repurchase       option ("rental repurchase vehicles") for the Automotive sector.  We       monitor residual values each month, and we review the adequacy of our       accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If we believe that the expected       residual values for our vehicles have changed, we revise depreciation to ensure       that our net investment in operating leases (equal to our acquisition value       of       the vehicles minus accumulated depreciation) will be adjusted to reflect our       revised estimate of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term.       For retail leases, such adjustments to depreciation expense would result in       a       change in the depreciation rates of the vehicles subject to operating leases,       and are recorded on a straight-line basis.  For       retail leases, each lease customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle       at       the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer. If the customer       returns the vehicle to the dealer, the dealer may buy the vehicle from us or       return it to us. Over the last three years, about 68% of Ford Credit’s North       America operating lease vehicles have been returned to us. For rental repurchase       vehicles, practically all vehicles are returned to us.  Nature       of Estimates Required. For       vehicles subject to operating leases, we establish an expected residual value       for the vehicle. We estimate the expected residual value by evaluating       historical auction values, historical return volumes for our retail leased       vehicles, industry-wide used vehicle prices, our marketing plans and vehicle       quality data.  Assumptions       Used. For       retail leases, our accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating       leases is based on our assumptions of:  • Auction       value.       The       market value of the vehicles when we sell them at the end of the lease;       and  • Return       volume.       The       number of vehicles that will be returned to us at lease end.  See       Note       12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding       accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases.  Sensitivity       Analysis. For       returned vehicles, we face a risk that the amount we obtain from the vehicle       sold at auction will be less than our estimate of the expected residual value       for the vehicle. At year-end 2005, if future auction values for retail operating       leases on Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles in the United States were       to       decrease by one percent from our present estimates, the impact would be to       increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about $40 million. Similarly,       if       return volumes for our existing portfolio of retail operating leases on Ford,       Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles in the United States were to increase by       one       percent from our present estimates, the impact would be to increase our       depreciation on these vehicles by about $5 million. These increases in       depreciation would be charged to depreciation expense during the 2006 through       2008 period so that the net investment in retail operating leases at the end       of       the lease term for these vehicles is equal to the revised expected residual       value. Adjustments to the amount of accumulated depreciation on retail operating       leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in Net       investment in operating leases       and on       our income statement in Depreciation,       in each       case under the Financial Services sector.   ACCOUNTING       STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED   In       May       2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting       Changes and Error Corrections - a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and       SFAS No. 3.       This       statement changes the requirements for accounting and reporting of a voluntary       change in accounting principle and changes required by an accounting       pronouncement when the specific transition provisions are absent. This statement       requires retrospective application to prior periods' financial statements of       changes in accounting principle. If it is impracticable to determine either       the       period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change, this statement       requires that the new accounting principle be adopted prospectively from the       earliest practicable date. SFAS No. 154 is effective in fiscal years beginning       after December 15, 2005. We do not expect any impact on our financial       position and results of operations.           54        ITEM             7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results             of             Operations (continued)     OFF-BALANCE       SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  We       have       entered into various arrangements not reflected on our balance sheet that have       or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial       condition, results of operations or liquidity. These include sales of       receivables by Ford Credit in off-balance sheet transactions, variable interest       entities and guarantees, each of which is discussed below.   Sales       of Receivables by Ford Credit  Securitization.       Ford       Credit sells receivables in securitizations and other structured financings       and       in whole-loan sale transactions. Some of these arrangements satisfy accounting       sale treatment and are not reflected on Ford Credit's balance sheet in the       same       way as debt funding. The remainder of these arrangements do not satisfy the       requirements for accounting sale treatment and the sold receivables and       associated debt are not removed from Ford Credit's balance sheet.  Securitization       involves the sale of a pool of receivables to a special purpose entity ("SPE"),       typically a trust. The SPE issues interest-bearing securities, commonly called       asset-backed securities, that are backed by the sold receivables. The SPE uses       proceeds from the sale of these securities to pay the purchase price for the       sold receivables. The SPE may only purchase the receivables, issue asset-backed       securities and make payments on the securities. The SPE has a limited duration       and generally is dissolved when investors holding the asset-backed securities       have been paid all amounts owed to them. Ford Credit's use of SPEs in       securitizations is consistent with conventional practices in the securitization       industry. The sale to the SPE achieves isolation of the sold receivables for       the       benefit of securitization investors and protects them from the claims of Ford       Credit's creditors. The use of SPEs combined with the structure of these       transactions means that the payment of the asset-backed securities is based       on       the creditworthiness of the underlying finance receivables and any enhancements       (as discussed below), and not Ford Credit's creditworthiness. As a result,       the       senior asset-backed securities issued by the SPEs generally receive the highest       short-term credit ratings and among the highest long-term credit ratings from       the credit rating agencies that rate them and are sold to securitization       investors at cost-effective pricing.   Ford       Credit's typical U.S. retail securitization is a two-step transaction. Ford       Credit sells a pool of its retail installment sale contracts to a wholly owned,       bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate SPE,       usually a trust, and transfers the receivables to the SPE in exchange for the       proceeds from securities issued by the SPE. The securities issued by the trust,       usually notes of various maturities and interest rates, are paid by the SPE       from       collections on the pool of receivables it owns. These securities are usually       structured into senior and subordinated classes. The senior classes have       priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from the sold       receivables. The receivables acquired by the SPE and the asset-backed securities       issued by the SPE are assets and obligations of the SPE.  The       following simplified diagram shows Ford Credit’s typical U.S. retail       securitization transaction:     Ford       Credit selects receivables at random for its securitization transactions using       selection criteria designed for the specific transaction. For securitizations       of       retail installment sale contracts, the selection criteria are based on factors       such as location of the obligor, contract term, payment schedule, interest       rate,       financing program, and the type of financed vehicle. In general, the criteria       also require receivables to be active and in good standing.  Ford       Credit retains interests in receivables sold through securitizations. The       retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities issued by       the       SPE, restricted cash held for the benefit of the SPE (for example, a reserve       fund) and residual interests in securitization transactions. Income from       residual interests in securitization transactions represents the right to       receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed       by the SPE to pay interest and principal to investors, servicing fees and other       required payments. Ford Credit retains credit risk in securitizations. Ford       Credit’s retained interests usually include the most          55        ITEM             7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results             of             Operations (continued)     subordinated       interests in the SPE, which are the first to absorb credit losses on the sold       receivables. Ford Credit's securitizations are structured to protect the holders       of the senior asset-backed securities such that, based on past experience,       any       credit losses in the pool of sold receivables would likely be limited to Ford       Credit's retained interests.   At       December 31, 2005 and 2004, the total outstanding principal amount of       receivables sold by Ford Credit in off-balance sheet securitizations was $18.0       billion and $35.6 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Ford       Credit’s retained interests in such sold receivables were $1.4 billion and $9.2       billion, respectively. The decline primarily reflected Ford Credit's accounting       consolidation of its off-balance sheet wholesale securitization program as       a       result of certain changes made to the program during the fourth quarter of       2005.  Ford       Credit generally has no obligation to repurchase or replace any receivable       sold       to an SPE that subsequently becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in       default. Investors holding securities issued by an SPE have no recourse to       Ford       Credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have       no       right to require it to repurchase the securities. Ford Credit does not guarantee       any asset-backed securities and has no obligation to provide liquidity or make       monetary contributions or contributions of additional receivables to its SPEs       either due to the performance of the sold receivables or the credit rating       of       Ford Credit's short-term or long-term debt. However, as the seller and servicer       of the finance receivables to the SPE, Ford Credit is obligated to provide       certain kinds of support to its securitizations, which are customary in the       securitization industry. These obligations consist of indemnifications,       receivable repurchase obligations on receivables that do not meet eligibility       criteria or that have been materially modified, the mandatory sale of additional       receivables in revolving transactions, and, in some cases, servicer advances       of       interest shortfalls.  Risks       to Continued Funding under Securitization Programs.       The       following securitization programs contain structural features that could prevent       Ford Credit from using these sources of funding in certain       circumstances:     ·    FCAR.                 If                 credit losses or delinquencies in Ford Credit's portfolio of retail,                 wholesale or lease receivables exceed specified levels, FCAR is not                 permitted to purchase additional asset-backed securities of the affected                 type for so long as such levels are exceeded. FCAR is permitted to                 purchase only highly-rated asset-backed securities, and if the credit                 enhancement on any asset-backed security purchased by FCAR is reduced                 to                 zero, FCAR may not purchase any additional asset-backed securities                 and                 would wind down its operations.         ·    Conduits.                 If                 credit losses or delinquencies on the pool of sold receivables held                 by a                 conduit exceed specified levels, or if the level of overcollateralization                 for such pool decreases below a specified level, Ford Credit will                 be                 unable to sell additional pools of receivables to that                 conduit.                ·   Wholesale                 Securitization and Motown Notes Program. If                 the payment rates on wholesale receivables are lower than specified                 levels, the SPE will be unable to issue additional securities and                 any                 existing securities would begin to amortize.       Based       on       its experience, Ford Credit does not expect that any of these features will       have       a material adverse impact on its ability to use securitization to fund its       operations.   In       addition to the specific transaction-related structural features discussed       above, Ford Credit’s ability to sell receivables in any of its securitization       programs may be affected by the following factors: the amount and credit quality       of receivables available to sell, the performance of receivables in its previous       receivables sales, general demand for the type of receivables supporting the       asset-backed securities, market capacity for Ford Credit and Ford       Credit-sponsored investments, accounting and regulatory changes, Ford Credit’s       credit rating, and the availability of liquidity facilities. If as a result       of       any of these or other factors the cost of securitized funding were to increase       significantly or funding through securitizations were no longer available to       Ford Credit, it would have a material adverse impact on Ford Credit's financial       condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Financial       Services sector. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we       enter       into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components       and services. These arrangements may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase       requirements. We enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply       of       these materials and services. "Purchase obligations" are defined as off-balance       sheet agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally       binding on the company and that specify all significant terms.  The       table       below summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005 (in       millions):     __________ * Principal       obligations only.

Quantitative       and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  OVERVIEW  We       are       exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes       in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, as well       as       risks to availability of funding sources, hazard events, and specific asset       risks.  These       risks affect our Automotive and Financial Services sectors differently. We       monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk       management program, which includes regular reports to a central management       committee, the Global Risk Management Committee ("GRMC"). The GRMC is chaired       by       our Chief Financial Officer, and its members include our Treasurer, our       Controller, and other members of senior management.  Our       Automotive and Financial Services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk, or       the       possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet       present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding       sources may be reduced or become unavailable. We, and particularly Ford Credit,       which comprises substantially all of our Financial Services sector, maintain       plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic       or business cycles. As discussed in greater detail in       "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition       and Results of Operations," our funding sources include sales of receivables       in       securitizations and other structured financings, unsecured debt issuances and       bank borrowings.  We       are       exposed to a variety of insurable risks, such as loss or damage to property,       liability claims, and employee injury. We protect against these risks through       a       combination of self-insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed       to protect against events that could generate significant losses.  Direct       responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies       resides with our Treasurer’s Office and is governed by written polices and       procedures. Separation of duties is maintained between the development and       authorization of derivative trades, the transaction of derivatives, and the       settlement of cash flows. Regular audits are conducted to ensure that       appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective. In addition,       our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures       are reviewed by the GRMC, and the Audit and Finance Committees of our Board       of       Directors.           57          ITEM                 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk                 (continued)       In       accordance with corporate risk management policies, we use derivative       instruments, such as forward contracts, swaps and options that economically       hedge certain exposures (foreign currency, commodity, and interest rates).       Derivative positions are used to manage underlying exposures; we do not use       derivative contracts for speculative purposes. In certain instances, we forgo       hedge accounting, which results in unrealized gains and losses that are       recognized currently in net income; examples of economic hedges that do not       qualify for hedge accounting include foreign currency hedges of inter-company       loans and dividends and certain transactions that use multiple hedge       instruments. For additional information on our derivatives, see Note 20 of       the       Notes to the Financial Statements.  The       market and counterparty risks of our Automotive sector and Ford Credit are       discussed and quantified below.  AUTOMOTIVE       MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK  Our       Automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in       foreign currencies, including the following: purchases and sales of finished       vehicles and production parts, debt and other payables, subsidiary dividends,       and investments in foreign operations. These expenditures and receipts create       exposures to changes in exchange rates. We also are exposed to changes in prices       of commodities used in our Automotive sector and changes in interest       rates.  Beginning       with this report, we have changed our risk disclosure methodology for foreign       currency risk and commodity risk to sensitivity analysis, which we believe       is a       more commonly used and more easily understood disclosure       alternative.  Foreign       currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model       to       evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of currency and commodity derivative       instruments with exposure to market risk that assumes instantaneous, parallel       shifts in rates and/or prices. For options and instruments with non-linear       returns, appropriate models are utilized to determine the impact of shifts       in       rates and prices.  Foreign       Currency Risk. Foreign       currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better       or       worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.       Accordingly, we use derivative instruments to hedge our economic exposure with       respect to forecasted revenues and costs, assets, liabilities, investments       in       foreign operations, and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies.       In       our hedging actions, we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations       to reduce foreign exchange risk (e.g., forward contracts and       options).  The       net       fair value of financial instruments with exposure to cash flow foreign currency       risk was a liability of $400 million as of December 31, 2005       compared to a net fair value asset of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2004.       The       potential decrease in fair value for such financial instruments, assuming a       10%       adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates, would be       $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2005 and December 31,       2004, respectively.   Commodity       Price Risk. Commodity       price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the       prices of commodities, such as non-ferrous metals (e.g., aluminum), precious       metals (e.g., palladium), ferrous metals (e.g., steel and iron castings), energy       (e.g., natural gas and electricity), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene),       which we use in the production of motor vehicles. Steel and resins are our       two       largest commodity exposures and are among the most difficult to       hedge.  We       use       derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase       of       those commodities that we can economically hedge (primarily non-ferrous metals,       precious metals and energies). In our hedging actions, we primarily use       instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk (e.g.,       financially settled forward contracts, swaps, and options).   The       net       fair value asset of commodity forward and option contracts as of December 31,       2005 and December 31, 2004 was $664 million and $294 million,       respectively. The potential decrease in fair value of commodity forward and       option contracts, assuming a 10% adverse change in the underlying commodity       price, would be approximately $200 million at both December 31, 2005       and December 31, 2004.  In       addition, our purchasing organization (with guidance from the GRMC as       appropriate) negotiates contracts to ensure continuous supply of raw materials.       In some cases, these contracts stipulate minimum purchase amounts and specific       prices, and as such, play a role in managing price risk.  Interest       Rate Risk. Interest       rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur in our Automotive       investment portfolio due to a change in interest rates. Our interest rate       sensitivity analysis on the investment portfolio includes cash and cash       equivalents,          58        ITEM             7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk             (continued)     marketable       and loaned securities and short-term VEBA assets. At December 31, 2005, we       had       $25.1 billion in our Automotive investment portfolio, compared to $23.6       billion at December 31, 2004. We invest the portfolio in securities of various       types and maturities, the value of which are subject to fluctuations in interest       rates. These securities are generally classified as either trading or       available-for-sale. The trading portfolio gains and losses (unrealized and       realized) are reported in the income statement. The available-for-sale portfolio       realized gains or losses are reported in the income statement, and unrealized       gains and losses are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders’ Equity in other comprehensive income. The investment strategy is based on       clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity, minimize       risk, and earn a reasonable return on the short-term investment.  At       any       time, a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the       fair       value of our trading and available-for-sale portfolios. As of December 31,       2005,       the value of our trading portfolio was $22.6 billion, which is $3.0 billion       higher than December 31, 2004. The value of our available-for-sale       portfolio was $2.5 billion, which is $1.5 billion lower than       December 31, 2004.  Assuming       a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point, the value       of       our trading and available-for-sale portfolios would be reduced by $91 million       and $28 million, respectively. This compares to $88 million and $45 million,       respectively, as calculated as of December 31, 2004. While these are our best       estimates of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario, actual results       could differ from those projected. The sensitivity analysis presented assumes       interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve.       In       reality, interest rate changes of this magnitude are rarely instantaneous or       parallel.  Counterparty       Risk. The       use       of derivatives to manage market risk results in counterparty risk, which is       the       loss we could incur if a counterparty defaulted on a derivative contract. We       enter into master agreements with counterparties that allow netting of certain       exposures in order to manage this risk. Exposures primarily relate to derivative       contracts used for managing interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and       commodity price risk. We, together with Ford Credit, establish exposure limits       for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification.         Our       approach to managing counterparty risk is forward-looking and proactive,       allowing us to take risk mitigation actions before risks become losses. We       establish exposure limits for both net fair value and future potential exposure,       based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings-based historical default       probabilities. The exposure limits are lower for lower-rated counterparties       and       for longer-dated exposures. We use a Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess       our potential exposure by tenor, defined at a 95% confidence level. We monitor       and report our exposures to the Treasurer on a monthly basis.  Substantially       all of our counterparty exposures are with counterparties that are rated       single-A or better. Our guidelines for counterparty minimum long-term ratings       is       BBB-. Exceptions to these guidelines require prior approval by       management.

FORD       CREDIT MARKET RISKS  Overview.       Ford       Credit is exposed to a variety of risks in the normal course of its business       activities. In addition to counterparty risk discussed above, Ford Credit is       subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify,       assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and       procedures:  • Market       risk.       The       possibility that changes in interest and currency exchange rates or prices       will       have an adverse impact on operating results;  • Credit       risk.       The       possibility of loss from a customer’s failure to make payments according to       contract terms;  • Residual       risk. The       possibility that the actual proceeds Ford Credit receives at lease termination       will be lower than its projections or return rates will be higher than its       projections; and,  • Liquidity       risk.       The       possibility that Ford Credit may be unable to meet all current and future       obligations in a timely manner.  Each       form       of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to Ford Credit’s       overall global risk. Business decisions are evaluated on a risk-adjusted basis       and products are priced consistent with these risks. Credit and residual risks       are discussed above in "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of       Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates"                59        ITEM             7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk             (continued)     and       liquidity risk is discussed above in "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and       Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and       Capital Resources." A discussion of Ford Credit’s market risks is included       below.  Foreign       Currency Risk. To       meet       funding objectives, Ford Credit issues debt or, for its international       affiliates, draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies. Ford Credit       faces exposure to currency exchange rate changes if a mismatch exists between       the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those       receivables. When possible, receivables are funded with debt in the same       currency, minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements. When a different       currency is used, Ford Credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange       rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives. These       derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations       to the local country currency of the receivables. As a result, Ford Credit’s       market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be       immaterial.  Interest       Rate Risk. Interest       rate risk is the primary market risk to which Ford Credit is exposed and       consists principally of "re-pricing risk" or differences in the re-pricing       characteristics of assets and liabilities. An instrument’s re-pricing period is       a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate-sensitive       instrument responds to changes in interest rates. It refers to the time it       takes       an instrument’s interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates. For       fixed-rate instruments, the re-pricing period is equal to the maturity for       repayment of the instrument’s principal because, with a fixed interest rate, the       principal is considered to re-price only when re-invested in a new instrument.       For a floating-rate instrument, the re-pricing period is the period of time       before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate. For instance, a       floating-rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually       on       December 31 would have a re-pricing period of one year on January 1,       regardless of the instrument’s maturity.  Ford       Credit’s receivables consist primarily of fixed-rate retail installment sale and       lease contracts and floating-rate wholesale receivables. Fixed-rate retail       installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities       ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal       monthly payments over the life of the contract. Ford Credit’s funding sources       consist primarily of sales of receivables in securitizations and short- and       long-term unsecured debt. In the case of unsecured term debt, and in an effort       to have funds available throughout the business cycle, Ford Credit may issue       debt with five- to ten-year maturities, which is generally longer than the       terms       of its assets. These debt instruments are principally fixed-rate and require       fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single       principal payment at maturity.  Ford       Credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists       between the re-pricing profile of its assets and debt. Specifically, without       derivatives, Ford Credit’s assets would re-price more quickly than its       debt.  Ford       Credit’s interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing       margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates. Ford       Credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range       and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management       program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest       rate       swaps.  On       a       monthly basis, Ford Credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value       of       its portfolio of interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities (its economic       value) to hypothetical changes in interest rates. Economic value is a measure       of       the present value of all future expected cash flows, discounted by market       interest rates, and is equal to the present value of interest rate-sensitive       assets minus the present value of interest rate-sensitive liabilities. Ford       Credit then enters into interest rate swaps, effectively converting portions       of       its floating-rate debt to fixed or its fixed-rate debt to floating, to ensure       that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target       range. Ford Credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest       rates using pre-tax net interest income simulation techniques. These simulations       calculate the projected pre-tax net interest income of its portfolio of interest       rate-sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios,       including both parallel and non-parallel shifts in the yield curve. These       quantifications of interest rate risk are reported to our Treasurer each       month.  The       process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk       of       Ford Credit’s operations in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom,       which together represented approximately 80% of its total on-balance sheet       finance receivables at December 31, 2005. For its other international       affiliates, Ford Credit uses a technique commonly referred to as "gap analysis,"       to measure re-pricing mismatch. This process uses re-pricing schedules, which       group assets, debt and swaps into discrete time bands based on their re-pricing       characteristics. Under this process, Ford Credit enters into interest rate       swaps, which effectively change the re-pricing profile of its debt, to ensure       that any re-pricing mismatch (between assets and liabilities) existing in a       particular time band falls within an established tolerance.  As       a       result of its interest rate risk management process, including derivatives,       Ford       Credit’s debt re-prices faster than its assets. Other things being equal, this       means that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest rates paid       on       Ford Credit’s debt will          60        ITEM             7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk             (continued)     increase       more rapidly than the interest rates earned on its assets, thereby initially       reducing Ford Credit’s pre-tax net interest income. Correspondingly, during a       period of falling interest rates, Ford Credit’s pre-tax net interest income       would be expected to initially increase. To provide a quantitative measure       of       the sensitivity of its pre-tax net interest income to changes in interest rates,       Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical,       instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point       across all maturities (a "parallel shift"), as well as a base case that assumes       that interest rates remain constant at existing levels. The differences between       these scenarios and the base case over a twelve-month period represent an       estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credit’s pre-tax net interest income. The       sensitivity as of year-end 2005 and 2004 was as follows:                      Pre-tax                 Net Interest Income                 impact given a one                 percentage point instantaneous                 increase in                 interest rates (in                 millions)     Pre-tax                 Net Interest Income                 impact given a one                 percentage point instantaneous                 decrease in                 interest rates (in                 millions)       December                 31, 2005     $   (40   )   $   40       December                 31, 2004       (93   )     93        Based       on       assumptions included in the analysis, sensitivity to a one percentage point       instantaneous change in interest rates was lower at year-end 2005 than at       year-end 2004. This change primarily reflects the results of normal fluctuations       within the approved tolerances of risk management strategy. While the       sensitivity analysis presented is Ford Credit’s best estimate of the impacts of       specified assumed interest rate scenarios, the model Ford Credit uses for this       analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions, so that actual results could       differ from those projected. Embedded in the model Ford Credit uses are       assumptions regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing       of maturing debt, and predicted repayment of retail installment sale and lease       contracts ahead of contractual maturity. Ford Credit’s repayment projections of       retail installment sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity are       based on historical experience. If interest rates or other factors were to       change, the actual prepayment experience could be different than       projected.  Additionally,       interest rate changes of one percentage point or more are rarely instantaneous       or parallel, and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point       assumed in Ford Credit’s analysis. As a result, the actual impact to pre-tax net       interest income could be higher or lower than the results detailed above. The       model used to conduct this analysis also relies heavily on assumptions regarding       the reinvestment of maturing asset principal, refinancing of maturing debt,       and       predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual       maturity.  The       fair       value of Ford Credit’s net derivative financial instruments (derivative assets       less derivative liabilities) as reported in Note 20 of the Notes to the       Financial Statements as of December 31, 2005 was $1.9 billion. This was       approximately $4.2 billion lower than a year ago. This decrease primarily       reflects weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar (primarily       Euro, British Pound and Yen), the maturity of swaps that were in the money,       and       lower mark-to-market adjustments resulting from interest rate changes.

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial       Disclosure  None.                  61                  ITEM       9A. Controls       and Procedures  EVALUATION       OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  William       Clay Ford, Jr., our Chief Executive Officer, and Donat R. Leclair, Jr., our       Chief Financial Officer, have performed an evaluation of the Company’s       disclosure controls and procedures, as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e)       of       the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as of       December 31, 2005 and each has concluded that such disclosure controls and       procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed       in       our periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,       summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities       and       Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.   MANAGEMENT’S       REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  Our       management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal       control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule       13a-15(f). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process       designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial       reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes       in       accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Because       of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may       not       prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of       effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become       inadequate because of changes in conditions or because the degree of compliance       with policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Under       the       supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief       Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an       assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting       as of December 31, 2005. The assessment was based on criteria       established in the framework Internal       Control - Integrated Framework,       issued       by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This       assessment excluded our acquisition on October 1, 2005 of operations of ACH       as       described in Note 4 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. As noted, ACH       is a       subsidiary controlled and managed by Ford, whose total assets and total revenues       represent less than 1% of the corresponding consolidated financial statement       amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005. Based on this       assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial       reporting was effective as of December 31, 2005. Management’s       assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial       reporting as of December 31, 2005 has been audited by       PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting       firm, as stated in their report included herein.  MATERIAL       CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL  During       the fourth quarter of 2005, our internal control over financial reporting was       affected materially by the acquisition of the operations of ACH and by the       sale       of Hertz, each of which is described in more detail in Note 4 of the Notes       to       the Financial Statements. In the case of ACH, in addition to accounting for       the       acquisition, many of the ongoing transactions between us and ACH (e.g., purchase       of components) that were third-party transactions before the acquisition are       now       intra-company transactions that must be eliminated in consolidation. By       contrast, with Hertz, many of the ongoing transactions between us and Hertz       (e.g., the sale of vehicles) that were intra-company transactions eliminated       in       consolidation before the sale are now third-party transactions.

accompanying notes are part of the financial statements.           FS-7                NOTE       1. PRINCIPLES OF PRESENTATION AND CONSOLIDATION  Our       financial statements are presented in accordance with principles generally       accepted in the United States and are shown on two bases: 1) consolidated basis       and 2) sector basis for Automotive and Financial Services. We believe the       additional information provided in the sector basis statements enables the       reader to better understand the operating performance, financial position,       cash       flow and liquidity of our two very different businesses. The primary difference       between the presentation of our sector balance sheet and our consolidated       balance sheet is the netting of deferred tax assets and       liabilities.  Our       financial statements include consolidated majority-owned subsidiaries and,       beginning July 1, 2003, consolidated Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”) of       which we are the primary beneficiary. Affiliates that we do not consolidate,       but       over whose operating and financial policies we have significant influence are       accounted for using the equity method. See Note 2 for discussion of accounting       policies.  We       have reclassified       certain prior year amounts to conform to current year presentation.  Presentation       of Cash Flows   Beginning       with our year ended December 31, 2005 statement of cash flows, we have changed       the presentation of cash flows to separately disclose the operating, investing,       and financing portions of the cash flows attributable to our discontinued       operations. This change is in response to public statements by the staff of       the       Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") concerning classification of       discontinued operations within the statement of cash flows. Beginning with       our       year ended December 31, 2004 consolidated statement of cash flows, we have       changed our presentation of cash flows from wholesale finance receivables.       This       change also stemmed from concerns raised by the SEC about the previous       presentation. Prior year disclosures have been revised to conform to current       year presentation.  Certain       Transactions Between Automotive and Financial Services       Sectors  Intersector       transactions occur in the ordinary course of business. We formally documented       certain long-standing business practices with Ford Motor Credit Company (“Ford       Credit”), a wholly owned subsidiary, in a 2001 agreement. Additional details on       certain transactions and the effect on each sector’s balance sheet at December       31 are shown below (in billions):            2005     2004                 Automotive     Financial Services       Automotive     Financial Services       Finance                 receivables, net (a)           $   5.5           $   3.0       Other                 assets (b)             1.1             0.8       Intersector                 receivables/(payables) (c)     $   (0.1   )     0.1     $   (2.8   )     2.8       __________     (a)   Automotive                 sector receivables (generated primarily from vehicle and parts sales                 to                 third parties) sold to Ford Credit. These receivables are classified                 as                 Other                 receivables, net on                 our consolidated balance sheet and Finance                 Receivables, net on                 our sector balance sheet.     (b)   Primarily                 used vehicles purchased by Ford Credit pursuant to the Automotive                 sector’s                 obligation to repurchase such vehicles from daily rental car companies,                 including Hertz. These vehicles are subsequently sold at                 auction.     (c)   At                 December 31, 2005, primarily amounts due the Automotive sector from                 Ford                 Credit under a tax sharing agreement and net result of all other                 transactions including receivables of Ford Credit from the Automotive                 sector's consolidated dealerships. At December 31, 2004, primarily                 amounts                 due Ford Credit and Hertz from the Automotive sector under tax sharing                 agreements and net result of all other transactions including receivables                 of Ford Credit from the Automotive sector's consolidated                 dealerships.      Additionally,       amounts recorded as revenue by the Financial Services sector and billed to       the       Automotive sector for interest and special financing and leasing programs were       $3.3 billion in 2005, $3.4 billion in 2004, and $3.5 billion in 2003. At       December 31, 2005, the Automotive sector has accrued in Accrued       liabilities and deferred revenue       approximately $3.0 billion for interest supplements and approximately $800       million for residual-value supplements in the United States and Canada to be       paid to Ford Credit over the term of the finance contracts.         FS-8          FORD             MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES             TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       NOTE       2. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Cash       and Cash Equivalents  Cash       and       all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the       date of purchase, including short-term time deposits and government agency       and       corporate obligations, are classified as Cash       and cash equivalents.  Revenue       Recognition — Automotive Sector  Sales       are       generally recorded when products are shipped, and the risks and rewards of       ownership are transferred to our customers (generally dealers).  We       also       sell vehicles to daily rental car companies that are subject to guaranteed       repurchase options. These vehicles are accounted for as operating leases. At       the       time of sale, the proceeds are recorded as deferred revenue in Accrued       liabilities and deferred revenue.       The       difference between the proceeds and the guaranteed repurchase amount is       recognized in Sales       over the       term of the lease. Also at the time of sale, the costs of the vehicles are       recorded as operating leases in Other       current assets.       The       difference between the cost of the vehicle and the estimated auction value       is       depreciated as Cost       of sales       over the       term of the lease. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, included in Accrued       liabilities and deferred revenue was       $4.6       billion and $3.5 billion, respectively and included in Other       current assets was       $4.1       billion and $2.9 billion, respectively for these vehicles.  Automotive       marketing incentives, including customer and dealer cash payments and costs       for       special financing and leasing programs paid to the Financial Services sector,       are recognized as revenue reductions and are accrued at the later of the date       the related vehicle sales are recorded or the date the incentive program is       both       approved and communicated. Costs for marketing incentives are based on       assumptions regarding the number of vehicles that will have a specific incentive       applied against them.  Income       generated from cash and cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities,       loaned securities and other miscellaneous receivables is reported as Interest       income and other non-operating income/(expense), net.  Revenue       Recognition — Financial Services Sector  Revenue       from finance receivables is recognized using the interest method. Certain       origination costs on receivables are deferred and amortized, using the interest       method, over the term of the related receivable as a reduction in financing       revenue. Rental revenue on operating leases is recognized on a straight-line       basis over the term of the lease. Initial direct costs related to leases are       deferred and amortized over the term of the lease. The accrual of interest       on       receivables is discontinued at the time a receivable is determined to be       uncollectible. Interest supplements paid by the Automotive sector are recognized       over the term of the receivable or operating lease.  Use       of Estimates  The       preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted       accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and       assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and       disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial       statements, and revenue and expenses during the periods reported. Estimates       are       used when accounting for certain items such as marketing accruals, warranty       costs, employee benefit programs, etc. Estimates are based on historical       experience, where applicable, and assumptions that management believes are       reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved       with estimates, actual results may differ from those estimates.  Selected       Other Costs  Freight,       engineering and research and development costs are included in cost of sales;       advertising costs are included in selling, administrative and other expenses.       Advertising, engineering and research and development costs are expensed as       incurred and were as follows (in billions):            2005     2004     2003       Advertising     $   5.0     $   4.6     $   4.1       Engineering,                 research and development       8.0       7.4       7.3                FS-9          FORD             MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES             TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       NOTE       2. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)  Sale       of Receivables  Ford       Credit sells finance receivables in securitization and whole-loan sales       transactions to fund our operations and to maintain liquidity. In many of our       securitization transactions, we surrender control over these assets by selling       finance receivables to securitization special purpose entities (“SPEs”).       Securitization entities are a common, required element of securitization       transactions to meet certain legal and transaction requirements that assure       that       the sold assets have been isolated from       our       creditors and us. The securitization entities generally issue interest-bearing       securities collateralized by future collections on the sold       receivables.  Receivables       are considered sold for accounting purposes when the receivables are transferred       beyond the reach of our creditors, the transferee has the right to pledge or       exchange the assets and we have surrendered control over the rights and       obligations of the receivables. If these criteria are satisfied, the receivables       are removed from our balance sheet at the time they are sold.  For       off-balance sheet sales of receivables, estimated gains or losses are recognized       in the period in which the sale occurs. We retain certain interests in       receivables sold in securitization transactions. These interests are recorded       at       fair value with unrealized gains or losses recorded, net of tax, in Accumulated       other comprehensive income/(loss),       a       component of stockholders' equity.  In       whole-loan sale transactions, we sell retail installment sale contracts to       a       buyer who either retains them or sells them in a subsequent asset-backed       securitization. We do not retain any interests in the sold receivables but       continue to service such receivables for a fee.  Certain       sales of receivables do not qualify for off-balance sheet treatment. As a       result, the sold receivables and associated debt are not removed from our       balance sheet and no gain or loss is recorded for these       transactions.   Foreign       Currency Translation  The       assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries using the local currency as       their       functional currency are translated to U.S. dollars based on current exchange       rates and any resulting translation adjustments are included in Accumulated       other comprehensive income/(loss). The       net       translation adjustment for 2005 was a decrease of $3.4 billion (net of tax       of       $299 million). The net adjustment reflects amounts transferred to net income       as       a result of the sale or liquidation of an entity, resulting in a       $116 million gain (primarily from the sale of Hertz).   Also       included in net income are the gains and losses arising from transactions       denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of a location,       the       impact of re-measuring assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries using       U.S.       dollars as their functional currency, and the results of our foreign currency       hedging activities; for additional discussion of hedging activities, see Note       20. The net after-tax income effects of these adjustments were gains of $609       million, $596 million and $454 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003       respectively.  Depreciation       and Amortization of Property, Plant and Equipment  Property       and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated primarily using the       straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. Useful lives       range from 3 years to 36 years. The estimated useful lives generally are 14.5       years for machinery and equipment and 30 years for buildings and land       improvements. Special tools placed in service beginning in 1999 are amortized       using the units-of-production method over the expected vehicle model cycle       life.       Maintenance, repairs, and rearrangement costs are expensed as       incurred.

SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)  Asset       Impairments  Discontinued       and Held-for-Sale Operations.       We       perform an impairment test on an asset group to be discontinued, held for sale,       or otherwise disposed of when management has committed to the action and the       action is expected to be completed within one year. We estimate fair value       to       approximate the expected proceeds to be received, less transaction costs and       compare it to the carrying       value of the asset group. An impairment charge is recognized when the carrying       value exceeds the estimated fair market value. When the estimated fair market       value exceeds the carrying value of the asset group, gain is recognized upon       disposal.   Long-Lived       Assets. We       monitor the carrying value of long-lived asset groups held and used for       potential impairment when certain triggering events have occurred. These events       include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection       of continuing losses, or a significant decrease in the market value. When a       triggering event occurs for long-lived asset groups held and used, a test for       recoverability is performed, comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows,       utilizing current cash       flow       information and expected growth rates, to the carrying value of the asset group.       If the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, internal and       external valuation experts are consulted. The asset group fair value is measured       relying primarily on the discounted cash flow methodology. Additionally, we       consider various market multiples (e.g., revenue and EBITDA) within the same       industry.  Supplier       Price Adjustments  We       frequently negotiate price adjustments with our suppliers throughout a       production cycle, even after receiving production material. These price       adjustments relate to changes in design specifications or to other commercial       terms such as economics, productivity, and competitive pricing and are       recognized in income when settled.        In       general, we avoid price changes in consideration of future business; however       when these occur, our policy is to defer the financial statement impact of       any       such price change given explicitly in consideration of future business where       guaranteed volumes are specified.

We do not expect that such       differences would have a material effect on the future financial statements       for       a particular year, although such an outcome is possible. No provision for       deferred taxes has been made on $550 million of unremitted earnings that are       considered to be indefinitely invested in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Deferred taxes       for these unremitted earnings are not practicable to estimate.  The       components of deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31 were as follows       (in millions):            2005     2004       Deferred                 tax assets                   Employee                 benefit plans     $   7,142     $   6,005       Dealer                 and customer allowances and claims       3,000       3,196       Tax                 credit carryforwards       2,173       2,736       Other                 foreign deferred tax assets       2,905       2,639       Allowance                 for credit losses       1,764       1,957       All                 other       6,103       5,623       Total                 gross deferred tax assets       23,087       22,156                           Less: valuation allowance        (248   )     (169   )                         Total net deferred tax assets        22,839       21,987                         Deferred                 tax liabilities                   Leasing                 transactions       7,736       7,913       Depreciation                 and amortization (excluding leasing transactions)       5,130       5,554       Finance                 receivables       2,839       2,826       All                 other       6,528       6,195       Total                 deferred tax liabilities       22,233       22,488       Net                 deferred tax assets/(liabilities)     $   606     $   (501   )              FS-12          FORD             MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES             TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       NOTE       3. INCOME TAXES (Continued)  Operating       loss carryforwards for tax purposes were $4.2 billion at December 31, 2005.       A       substantial portion of these losses has an indefinite carryforward period;       the       remaining losses will begin to expire in 2006. Tax credits available to offset       future tax liabilities       are $2.2 billion. A substantial portion has an indefinite carryforward period;       the remainder begins to expire in 2017. Tax benefits of operating loss and       tax       credit carryforwards are evaluated on an ongoing basis, including a review       of       historical and projected future operating results, the eligible carryforward       period, and other circumstances. Management believes that it is more likely       than       not that a substantial amount of the deferred tax assets will be realized;       a       valuation allowance has been established for the remainder. The amount of the       deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the       near       term if estimates of future U.S. taxable income are lower than       expected.  On       October 22, 2004, President Bush signed into law The       American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("the       Act"). The Act provides for a one-year period to repatriate certain foreign       earnings at a special tax rate if those earnings are invested in certain U.S.       activities. We remitted such earnings during the year. As identified in our       dividend reinvestment plan, our primary U.S. investment of the dividend amount       was cash compensation and benefits (excluding executive compensation) to or       for       the benefit of employees performing services in the United States. Our fourth       quarter results reflect a $250 million tax benefit related to this       provision.  During       the second quarter of 2005, we settled, on a favorable basis, various claims       and       disputes related to prior year taxes.

In       2004,       the Automotive sector completed the disposition of several of its non-core       businesses initiated in 2002 and 2003, including our former automotive recycling       businesses in the United States and Canada, our electric vehicle business in       Norway, and our insurance-related products and services business in the United       Kingdom. Associated with the disposition of these entities, we recorded pre-tax       charges of $9 million and $105 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, reflected       in Income/(loss)       from discontinued operations.  In       2004,       we sold our Formula One racing operations as these operations were not       consistent with our Premier Automotive Group ("PAG") Improvement Plan nor our       goals to build on the basics and focus on our core business. We recorded pre-tax       charges of $204 million for impairment of goodwill, $23 million related to       write-down of inventory and $77 million for loss on sale.  The       results of all discontinued Automotive sector operations are as follows (in       millions):            2005     2004     2003       Sales     $   3     $   192     $   410                               Operating                 income/(loss) from discontinued operations     $   (4   )   $   (184   )   $   (65   )     Gain/(loss)                 on discontinued operations       13       (165   )     (105   )     (Provision                 for)/benefit from income taxes       (3   )     122       29       Income/(loss)                 from discontinued operations     $   6     $   (227   )   $   (141   )      At       December 31, 2005 and 2004, there were no significant assets or liabilities       remaining on our balance sheet related to discontinued operations.  Held-for-Sale       Operations. In       2004,       management committed to sell certain consolidated dealerships in the Asia       Pacific and Africa/Mazda segment as the sale of the dealerships would allow       us       to concentrate on the production and marketing of our products in the Asia       Pacific region rather than the day-to-day retailing operations. In 2004, we       recorded pre-tax charges of $64 million reflected in Cost       of sales for the       impairment of goodwill and $16 million in Interest       income and other non-operating income/(expense), net for       the       estimated loss on disposal. In 2005, we completed the sale and recognized a       pre-tax gain of $14 million reflected in Interest       income and other non-operating income/(expense), net.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, HELD-FOR-SALE OPERATIONS, OTHER DISPOSITIONS, AND       ACQUISITIONS (Continued)  In       2005,       we acquired the minority interest in the Beanstalk Group, LLC ("Beanstalk"),       a       majority-owned subsidiary that licensed trademarks, and subsequently sold our       100% interest. Its operations were not consistent with our objective to focus       on       our core automotive business. We recorded pre-tax charges of $53 million for       the       impairment of intangible assets and goodwill in Cost       of sales       and $12       million in Interest       income and other non-operating income/(expense), net       for the       loss on sale.  At       December 31, 2005, there were no assets or liabilities on our balance sheet       related to held-for-sale operations. At December 31, 2004, the assets       of the held-for-sale operations consisted primarily of receivables and inventory       totaling approximately $49 million and $114 million, respectively.  Other       Dispositions. In       2005,       we completed the sale of our interests in Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd.       (approximately 5% interest), Vastera, Inc. (approximately 19% interest), and       Kwik-Fit Group Limited (approximately 18% interest). As a result of the sales,       we recognized pre-tax gains of approximately $22 million, $11 million, and       $152       million, respectively in Interest       income and other non-operating income/(expense), net.         We       also       completed the exchange of 8.3 million shares in Ballard Power Systems Inc.       ("Ballard") for an equity interest (50%) in NuCellSys, GmbH, a 50/50 joint       venture with DaimlerChrysler Corporation. As a result of the exchange and the       retirement of certain restrictions, we recognized in Cost       of sales       a       pre-tax charge of $61 million. Our ownership interest in Ballard is 11.5%.       We       continue to report this investment under the equity method.   Acquisitions.       We       also       finalized an agreement with Visteon Corporation ("Visteon"), our largest       supplier, in which we assumed control of 17       plants and six other facilities in the United States and Mexico. These       assets were transferred to Automotive Components Holdings, LLC ("ACH"), a       temporary business controlled and managed by us, to protect the flow of critical       parts and components in the near-term and, over time, to improve our sourcing       flexibility and cost competitiveness. ACH's mission is to prepare most of the       acquired businesses for sale to companies with the capital and expertise to       supply us with high-quality components and systems at competitive prices. We       consolidated ACH on October 1, 2005 as part of The Americas       segment.  The       total       2005 pre-tax loss from the transaction was $468 million reflected in Cost       of sales,       summarized as follows (in millions):      Value                 of ACH Assets/(Liabilities) Received on October 1,                 2005             Net                 property     $   427       Inventory       299       Warrants                 for purchase of Visteon stock       165       Other                 net liabilities       (10   )     Total     $   881                   Cash                 Paid/Liabilities Assumed             Forgiveness                 of employee-related liabilities*     $   (500   )     Cash                 paid to escrow account for Visteon restructuring       (400   )     Cash                 paid for inventories       (299   )     Liability                 recorded for Visteon restructuring       (150   )     Total     $   (1,349   )     __________       *   As                 part of the transaction, we forgave $1.1 billion of Visteon's liability                 to                 us for employee-related costs of which $600 million was recognized                 in 2004                 as an allowance for doubtful                 accounts.      In       2004,       we acquired 100% ownership of ZF Batavia, LLC (renamed Batavia Transmissions,       LLC) from ZF Transmissions Technologies LLC. ZF Transmission Technologies LLC,       is a company we jointly own (49%) with ZF Friedrichshafen Germany       (51%).  In       June 2000, we purchased the Land Rover sport utility vehicle business from       the BMW Group. As part of the acquisition, we agreed to pay two-thirds of the       purchase price at closing with the remainder being paid in 2005. During 2005,       we       made the final payment of approximately $1.3 billion.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, HELD-FOR-SALE OPERATIONS, OTHER DISPOSITIONS, AND       ACQUISITIONS (Continued)  Financial       Services Sector  Discontinued       Operations. Consistent       with our strategy to focus on our core business, we completed the disposition       of       the operations discussed below.   In       2004,       we committed to a plan to sell Triad Financial Corporation, our operation in       the       United States that specialized in automobile retail installment sales contracts       with borrowers who generally would not be expected to qualify, based on their       credit worthiness, for traditional financing sources such as those provided       by       commercial banks or automobile manufacturers' affiliated finance companies.       During 2005, we completed the sale of this business and recognized a pre-tax       loss of approximately $16 million.   In       2004,       we completed the sale of AMI Leasing and Fleet Management Services, our       operation in the United States that offered full service car and truck leasing.       During 2003, we recognized a pre-tax charge of $50 million, reflected in Income/(loss)       from discontinued operations for       the       loss on sale. This amount represented the difference between the selling price       of these assets, less costs to sell them, and their recorded book       value.  In       2003,       we completed the sale of Axus, our all-makes vehicle fleet leasing operations       in       Europe, New Zealand and Australia. In 2002, we recognized a pre-tax charge       of       $31 million, reflected in Income/(loss)       from discontinued operations for       the       loss on sale. This amount represented the difference between the selling price       of these assets, less costs to sell them, and their recorded book       value.

Held-for-sale       Operations. During       2005, management committed to sell Hertz as it is not core to our Automotive       business. On September 12, 2005, we entered into a definitive       agreement with an investor group of private equity firms under which we agreed       to sell Hertz in a transaction valued at approximately $15 billion       including debt. On December 21, 2005, we completed, through our       wholly-owned subsidiary Ford Holdings LLC, the sale of our 100% ownership       interest in Hertz to CCMG Investor, LLC.  We       received $5.6 billion in cash for the sale of Hertz. As part of the       transaction, we provided cash-collateralized letters of credit in an aggregate       amount of $200 million to support the asset-backed portion of the buyer's       financing for the transaction. These letters of credit will expire no later       than       December 21, 2011. As a result of the sale, we recognized in Gain       on sale of Hertz, a       pre-tax       gain of $1.1 billion, inclusive of $27 million of charges to record the       estimated fair value of the letters of credit. For further discussion of these       letters of credit, see Note 27.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, HELD-FOR-SALE OPERATIONS, OTHER DISPOSITIONS, AND       ACQUISITIONS (Continued)  At       December 31, 2005, there were no assets or liabilities on our balance sheet       related to held-for-sale operations. The assets and liabilities of Hertz       classified as discontinued/held-for-sale operations at December 31, 2004 are       summarized as follows (in millions):          December                 31, 2004       Assets             Cash                 and cash equivalents     $   679       Finance                 receivables       1,283       Net                 investment in operating leases       9,111       Goodwill                 and other intangibles       877       Other                 assets       2,022       Total                 assets of held-for-sale operations     $   13,972                   Liabilities             Payables     $   1,538       Debt       8,428       Other                 liabilities       1,372       Total                 liabilities of held-for-sale operations      $   11,338         NOTE       5. MARKETABLE, LOANED AND OTHER SECURITIES  Trading       securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included       in income. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with net       unrealized holding gains and losses reported, net of tax, in Accumulated       other comprehensive income/(loss).       Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost. Realized gains       and       losses are accounted for using the specific identification method.  The       fair       value of substantially all securities is determined by quoted market prices.       The       estimated fair value of securities for which there are no quoted market prices       is based on similar types of securities that are traded in the market. Book       value approximates fair value for all securities.  Expected       maturities of debt securities may differ from contractual maturities because       borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without       penalty.  We       loan       certain securities from our portfolio to other institutions. Such securities       are       classified as Loaned       securities.       Collateral for the loaned securities, consisting of cash or other securities,       is       required to be maintained at a rate of 102% of the market value of a loaned       security. We received securities as collateral in the amount of       $2.8 billion and $399 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. This       collateral has not been pledged or sold. Cash collateral received is recorded       as       an asset in Other       current assets,       offset       by an obligation to return the collateral in Other       liabilities.

These investments are recorded at fair value and included in Other       Assets       on our       balance sheet. At December 31, 2005, the fair value and unrealized loss of       these       assets that have been in a continuous loss position for less that twelve months       was $318 million and $1 million, respectively, and the fair value and       unrealized loss of these assets in a continuous loss position for twelve months       or greater was $128 million and $1 million, respectively.  Management       has determined that the unrealized losses on our investments in debt and equity       securities at December 31, 2005 are temporary in nature. Factors       considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of       time       and extent to which fair value has been below cost, the financial condition       and       near-term prospects of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the       investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated       recovery.

About one-fourth of inventories were       determined under the last-in, first-out method ("LIFO").  During       2005, inventory quantities were reduced, resulting in a liquidation of LIFO       inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years as       compared with the cost of 2005 purchases, the effect of which decreased cost       of       goods sold by approximately $12 million.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  During       2005, we updated our PAG Improvement Plan for the Jaguar/Land Rover operating       unit within our Ford Europe and PAG segment. We project a decline in net cash       flows for the Jaguar/Land Rover operating unit based on updated market       projections primarily reflecting recent market performance for Jaguar. As a       result, we tested the long-lived assets of this operating unit for       recoverability and recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $1.3 billion in Cost       of sales       as the       carrying value of these assets exceeded the fair value.  During       the fourth quarter of 2005, we reviewed the Way Forward plan for the Ford North       America business unit of our The Americas segment. The Way Forward plan was       approved in the first quarter of 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we tested       the long-lived assets of the Ford North America business unit for recoverability       using net cash flows revised for the Way Forward plan. We concluded the       long-lived assets of Ford North America are not impaired.   As       a       result of these actions, we also re-evaluated our annual goodwill impairment       test performed in the second quarter of 2005 and have determined that an       impairment charge is not warranted.  NOTE       10. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES  Our       policy is to perform annual testing on goodwill and certain other intangible       assets to determine if any impairment has occurred. The test is conducted on       a       reporting unit level that is aligned with our current senior management       structure. To test for impairment, the carrying value of each reporting unit       is       compared with its fair value. Fair value is estimated using the present value       of       free cash flows method. In the second and fourth quarter of 2005, fair value       was       calculated using our best available estimate of future free cash flows. No       impairment resulted from this testing.

In measuring the impairment, the carrying value of these       operations, including goodwill, was compared to a third-party valuation.       Beanstalk was subsequently sold in October 2005. In connection with the       acquisition of several dealerships, we acquired $55 million of goodwill in       2005.  In       addition to the goodwill presented in the above table, during the fourth quarter       of 2005, we sold Hertz, including $640 million in goodwill and       $232 million in intangibles which were classified as Assets       of discontinued/held-for-sale operations.       Additionally, included in Equity       in net assets of affiliated companies       was       goodwill of $217 million at December 31, 2005. This included an       increase of $83 million related to the conversion of our investment in Mazda       convertible bonds to an investment in Mazda's equity, and a decrease of $32       million related primarily to our investment in Ballard.   The       components of identifiable intangible assets at December 31 were as follows       (in       millions):            2005     2004           Automotive                   Sector     Financial                   Services Sector     Automotive                   Sector     Financial                   Services Sector             Amortizable     Non-amortizable       Amortizable       Amortizable     Non-amortizable       Amortizable       Gross                   carrying amount     $   558     $   431     $   4     $   604     $   484     $   4       Less:                   accumulated amortization       (169   )     —       (4   )     (150   )     —       (4   )     Net                   intangible assets     $   389     $   431     $   —     $   454     $   484     $   —           Pre-tax       amortization expense related to these intangible assets for the year ended       December 31, 2005 was       $55 million. Intangible asset amortization is forecasted to range from $30       million to $40 million per year for the next five years, excluding the       impact of foreign currency translation.

Finance       receivables that originated outside the United States were $46.4 billion and       $51.9 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Other finance       receivables consisted primarily of real estate, commercial and other       collateralized loans and accrued interest.  Included       in net finance and other receivables at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $44.7       billion and $16.9 billion, respectively, of receivables that have been sold       for       legal purposes to consolidated securitization SPEs and are available only for       repayment of debt issued by those entities, and to pay other securitization       investors and other participants; they are not available to pay our other       obligations or the claims of our other creditors.  The       fair       value of most finance receivables is calculated by discounting future cash       flows       using an estimated discount rate that reflects the current credit, interest       rate       and prepayments risks associated with similar types of instruments. For       receivables with short maturities, the book value approximates fair       value.

FINANCE RECEIVABLES — FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR       (Continued)  At       December 31, 2005, finance receivables included $1.6 billion owed by the three       customers with the largest receivables balances.  Future       maturities of total finance receivables, including minimum lease rentals are       $74.3 billion for 2006, $20.5 billion for 2007, $10.9 billion for 2008, and       $7.1       billion thereafter. Experience indicates that a substantial portion of the       portfolio generally is repaid before the contractual maturity       dates.  Included       in retail receivables above are investments in direct financing leases.

NET INVESTMENT IN OPERATING LEASES   The       net       investment in operating leases at December 31 was as follows (in       millions):            2005     2004       Financial                 Services Sector                   Vehicles                 and other equipment, at cost     $   29,489     $   30,799       Accumulated                 depreciation       (6,344   )     (7,842   )     Allowances                 for credit losses       (194   )     (305   )     Total                 Financial Services       22,951       22,652       Automotive                 Sector                   Vehicles,                 net of depreciation        4,148       2,912       Total     $   27,099     $   25,564        Financial       Services Sector  Included       in net investment in operating leases at December 31, 2005 were interests in       operating leases and the related vehicles of $6.5 billion that have been       transferred for legal purposes to consolidated securitization SPEs and are       available only for repayment of debt issued by those entities, and to pay other       securitization investors and other participants; they are not available to       pay       our other obligations or the claims of our other creditors.   The       amounts contractually due for minimum rentals on operating leases are $3.5       billion for 2006, $3.0 billion for 2007, $1.8 billion for 2008,       $441 million for 2009, $75 million for 2010, and $285 million       thereafter.   Assets       subject to operating leases are depreciated primarily on the straight-line       method over the term of the lease to reduce the asset to its estimated residual       value. Estimated residual values are based on assumptions for used vehicle       prices at lease termination and the number of vehicles that are expected to       be       returned. Operating lease depreciation expense (which includes gains and losses       on disposal of assets) was $5.7 billion in 2005, $6.4 billion in 2004, and       $8.5       billion in 2003.

SALES OF RECEIVABLES — FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR  Servicing       Portfolio  We       retain       servicing rights for receivables sold in off-balance sheet securitization and       whole-loan sale transactions. The servicing portfolio is summarized in the       following table (in millions):      In       the       fourth quarter of 2005, we consolidated our off-balance sheet wholesale       securitization program as a result of certain changes authorized in accordance       with the transaction documents. The accounting consolidation did not have an       impact on our earnings, back-up credit facilities, unsecured debt programs       or       other securitization programs. This transaction was primarily non-cash and       increased receivables $17.9 billion and debt $15.8 billion upon       consolidation.  Retained       Interest  Components       of retained interest in off-balance sheet securitized assets at December 31       include (in millions):            2005     2004       Residual                 interest in securitization transactions     $   1,094     $   756       Restricted                 cash held for benefit of securitization SPEs       199       503       Subordinated                 securities       127       875       Interest                 in sold wholesale receivables and other trust assets       —       6,904       Senior                 securities       —       128       Retained                 interest in securitized assets     $   1,420     $   9,166        Investments       in subordinated securities and restricted cash are senior to the residual       interest in securitization transactions. Retained interests are recorded at       fair       value. The fair value of subordinated and senior securities is estimated based       on market prices. In determining the fair value of residual interest in       securitization transactions, we discount the present value of the projected       cash       flows retained at the transaction discount rate.

The weighted-average life of the underlying assets was 51.9       months. For the year ended December 31, 2004, point-of-sale assumptions in       our       retail transactions included discount rates of 11.0% to 13.5%, prepayment speeds       of 0.8% to 1.5% and credit losses of 0.8% to 2.8% over the life of sold       receivables. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the weighted-average life       of       the underlying assets was 50.2 months.

These receivables and interests in operating leases and       the       related vehicles are only for repayment of debt issued by those entities, and       to       pay other securitization investors and other participants; they are not       available to pay our other obligations or the claims of our other creditors.       At       December 31, 2005 and 2004, associated debt of $39.8 billion and $16.5 billion,       respectively, was issued by the SPEs and includes both asset-backed commercial       paper and notes payable out of collections on these receivables and interests       in       operating leases and the related vehicles. This debt is the legal obligation       of       the SPEs, but for financial statement reporting purposes is reported as debt       on       our balance sheet.   NOTE       14. ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES — FINANCIAL SERVICES       SECTOR  The       allowance for credit losses is our estimate of the credit losses related to       impaired receivables and operating leases at the date of the financial       statements. This allowance is based on factors including historical credit       loss       trends, the credit quality of our present portfolio, trends in historical and       projected used vehicle values and general economic measures. Additions to the       allowance for credit losses are made by recording charges to the provision       for       credit losses on our statement of income. Finance receivables and lease       investments are charged to the allowance for credit losses at the earlier of       when an account is deemed to be uncollectible or when an account is 120 days       delinquent, taking into consideration the financial condition of the borrower       or       lessee, the value of the collateral, recourse to guarantors and other factors.       Recoveries on finance receivables and lease investments previously charged       off       as uncollectible are credited to the allowance for credit losses.  The       allowance for credit losses is included in Finance       receivables, net       and Net       investment in operating leases.       Changes       in the allowance for credit losses for finance receivables, investment in direct       financing leases and investment in operating leases were as follows (in       millions):            2005     2004     2003       Beginning                 balance     $   2,471     $   2,962     $   3,054       Provision                 for credit losses       167       923       1,928       Total                 charge-offs and recoveries                         Charge-offs       (1,184   )     (1,843   )     (2,409   )     Recoveries       478       477       475       Net                 charge-offs       (706   )     (1,366   )     (1,934   )     Other                 changes, principally amounts related to finance receivables sold                 and                 translation adjustments       (338   )     (48   )     (86   )     Ending                 balance     $   1,594     $   2,471     $   2,962                FS-25          FORD             MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES             TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       NOTE       15.

Subordinated       Indebtedness  Ford       Motor Company Capital Trust II, a subsidiary trust (“Trust II”), has outstanding       6.50% Cumulative Convertible Trust Preferred Securities with an aggregate       liquidation preference of $5 billion (the “Trust II Preferred Securities”). The       sole assets of Trust II are $5.2 billion principal amount of 6.50% Junior       Subordinated Debentures due 2032 of Ford Motor Company (the “Subordinated       Debentures”). At our option, we may redeem the Subordinated Debentures, in whole       or in part, on or after January 15, 2007. To the extent we redeem the       Subordinated Debentures or upon the maturity of the Subordinated Debentures,       Trust II is required to redeem the Trust II Preferred Securities at $50 per       share plus accrued and unpaid distributions. We guarantee the payment of all       distribution and other payments of the Trust II Preferred Securities to the       extent not paid by Trust II, but only if and to the extent we have made a       payment of interest or principal on the Subordinated Debentures. Trust II is       not       consolidated by us as it is a VIE in which we do not have a significant variable       interest and of which we are not the primary beneficiary.   Credit       Facilities*  Automotive       Sector  At       December 31, 2005, the Automotive sector had $7.1 billion of contractually       committed credit facilities with financial institutions, of which $6.9 billion       were available for use. Of the lines available for use, 74% are committed       through June 30, 2010. Of the $7.1 billion, $6.5 billion constitute       global credit facilities and may be used, at our option, by any of our direct       or       indirect majority-owned subsidiaries on a guaranteed basis. We also have the       ability to transfer, on a non-guaranteed basis, $2.2 billion of such global       credit facilities to Ford Credit and approximately $500 million to FCE Bank       plc       ("FCE"), Ford Credit's European operation. All of the global credit facilities       are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants       (for example, debt-to-equity limitations, minimum net worth requirements and       credit rating triggers) that would limit our ability to borrow.   Financial       Services Sector  At       December 31, 2005, the Financial Services Sector had $6.2 billion of       contractually committed credit facilities with financial institutions, of which       $5.1 billion were available for use. Of the lines available for use, 36% are       committed through June 30, 2010. Of the $6.2 billion, $3.8 billion are       Ford Credit facilities ($3.2 billion global and approximately $600 million       non-global) and $2.4 billion are FCE facilities ($2.3 billion global and       approximately $100 million non-global). The global credit facilities may be       used, at Ford Credit's or FCE's option, by any of their direct or indirect       majority-owned subsidiaries. Ford Credit or FCE, as the case may be, will       guarantee any such borrowings. All of the global credit facilities have       substantially identical contract terms (other than commitment amounts) and       are       free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants       (for       example, debt-to-equity limitations, minimum net worth requirements and credit       rating triggers) that would limit our ability to borrow.   Additionally,       at December 31, 2005, banks provided $18.7 billion of contractually committed       liquidity facilities exclusively to support Ford Credit's two on-balance sheet,       asset-backed commercial paper programs; $18.2 billion       supported Ford Credit's retail         FS-27          FORD             MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES             TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       NOTE       16. DEBT AND COMMITMENTS (Continued)  securitization       program ("FCAR") and $500 million supported the wholesale securitization program       ("Motown Notes"). The FCAR and Motown Notes program must be supported by       liquidity facilities equal to at least 100% and 5%, respectively, of their       face       amount. At December 31, 2005, about $17.7 billion of FCAR's bank credit       facilities were available to support FCAR's asset-backed commercial paper or       subordinated debt. The remaining $500 million of available credit lines could       be       accessed for additional funding if FCAR issued additional subordinated debt.       Utilization of these facilities is subject to conditions specific to each       program and Ford Credit having a sufficient amount of securitizable assets.       At       December 31, 2005, the outstanding balances were approximately       $15.3 billion for the FCAR program and $6.5 billion for the Motown       Notes program.  __________ * Credit       facilities of our VIEs are excluded as we do not control their use.   NOTE       17. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES  We       consolidate VIEs of which we are the primary beneficiary. The liabilities       recognized as a result of consolidating these VIEs do not represent additional       claims on our general assets; rather, they represent claims against the specific       assets of the consolidated VIEs. Conversely, assets recognized as a result       of       consolidating these VIEs do not represent additional assets that could be used       to satisfy claims against our general assets. Reflected in our December 31,       2005       balance sheet are $5.5 billion of VIE assets related to VIEs that were       consolidated.  During       2003, as a result of consolidating VIEs of which we are the primary beneficiary,       we recognized a non-cash charge of $264 million in Cumulative       effects of changes in accounting principles.       The       charge represented the difference between the fair value of the assets,       liabilities and minority interests recorded upon consolidation and the carrying       value of the investments. Recorded assets exclude goodwill.   Automotive       Sector  VIEs       of which we are the primary beneficiary:  The       activities with the joint ventures described below include purchasing       substantially all of the joint ventures' output under a cost plus margin       arrangement and/or volume dependent pricing. Described below are the most       significant of the VIEs that were consolidated.  AutoAlliance       International, Inc. ("AAI") is a 50/50 joint venture with Mazda in North       America. AAI is engaged in the manufacture of automobiles on behalf of Ford       and       Mazda, primarily for sale in North America. As a result of changes in the       contractual arrangements between Ford, Mazda and AAI in the third quarter of       2005, we consolidated AAI.   Ford       Otosan ("Otosan") is a joint venture in Turkey with the Koc Group of Turkey       (41%       partner) and public investors (18%). Otosan is the single assembly supplier       of       the Ford Transit Connect and an assembly supplier of the Ford Transit       van.  Getrag       Ford Transmissions GmbH ("GFT") is a 50/50 joint venture with Getrag Deutsche       Venture GmbH & Co. KG, a German company, to which we transferred our       European manual transmission operations in Halewood, England; Cologne, Germany       and Bordeaux, France. GFT is the primary supplier of manual transmissions for       use in our European vehicles.  Tekfor       Cologne GmbH ("Tekfor") is a 50/50 joint venture with Neumayer Tekfor GmbH,       a       German company to which we transferred our Cologne forging operations. Tekfor       produces transmission and chassis components for use in our vehicles.   We       hold       interests in certain Ford and/or Lincoln Mercury dealerships. At December 31,       2005, we consolidated a portfolio of approximately 135 dealerships that are       part       of the Dealer Development program. The program's purpose is to facilitate the       establishment of independent franchised dealers by allowing a participating       dealership to become the sole owner of a Ford and/or Lincoln Mercury dealership       corporation by purchasing equity from us using the operator's share of       dealership net profits. We supply and finance the majority of vehicles and       parts       to these dealerships and the operators have a contract to buy our equity       interest over a period of time.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (Continued)  VIEs       of which we are not the primary beneficiary:  During       the third quarter of 2005, as part of the Hertz transaction, Ford provided       cash-collateralized letters of credit to support the payment obligations of       Hertz Vehicle Financing, a VIE which is wholly owned by Hertz of which we are       not the primary beneficiary. The fair value of our obligation related to these       letters of credit, which will expire no later than December 21, 2011,       is approximately $27 million. For additional discussion of these letters of       credit, see Note 27.   The       risks       and rewards associated with our interests in joint ventures which are VIEs       of       which we are not the primary beneficiary are based primarily on ownership       percentages. Our maximum exposure (approximately $158 million at       December 31, 2005) to any potential losses, should they occur,       associated with these VIEs is limited to equity investments.   Financial       Services Sector  VIEs       of which we are the primary beneficiary:  Ford       Credit uses SPEs in a variety of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet       securitization transactions. On-balance sheet SPEs discussed in Note 11 are       considered VIEs of which Ford Credit is the primary beneficiary and have been       consolidated.  VIEs       of which we are not the primary beneficiary:  Ford       Credit has investments in certain joint ventures deemed to be VIEs of which       it       is not the primary beneficiary. The risks and rewards associated with Ford       Credit’s interests in these entities are based primarily on ownership       percentages. Ford Credit’s  maximum       exposure (approximately $182 million at December 31, 2005) to any potential       losses, should they occur, associated with these VIEs is limited to its equity       investments and, where applicable, receivables due from the VIEs.  Ford       Credit also sells, under contractually-committed agreements, finance receivables       to bank-sponsored asset-backed commercial paper issuers that are SPEs of the       sponsor bank; these SPEs are not consolidated by us. In addition, certain of       these SPEs hold notes issued by Ford Credit that are backed by interests in       operating leases and the related vehicles, which reduce the commitment of these       SPEs to purchase finance receivables. At December 31, 2005, approximately       $5.6 billion of finance receivables and notes were held by these       SPEs.   NOTE       18. CAPITAL STOCK AND AMOUNTS PER SHARE  All       general voting power is vested in the holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock.       Holders of Common Stock have 60% of the general voting power and holders of       Class B Stock are entitled to such number of votes per share as would give       them       the remaining 40%. Shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock share equally in       dividends, with stock dividends payable in shares of stock of the class held.       If       liquidated, each share of Common Stock will be entitled to the first $0.50       available for distribution to holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock, each       share of Class B Stock will be entitled to the next $1.00 so available, each       share of Common Stock will be entitled to the next $0.50 so available and each       share of Common and Class B Stock will be entitled to an equal amount       thereafter.  As       discussed in Note 16, Trust II Preferred Securities with an aggregate       liquidation preference of $5 billion are outstanding. At the option of the       holder, each Preferred Security is convertible, at any time on or before January       15, 2032, into shares of our Common Stock at a rate of 2.8249 shares for each       Preferred Security (equivalent to a conversion price of $17.70 per share).       Conversion of all shares of such securities would result in the issuance of       282       million shares of our Common Stock.

CAPITAL STOCK AND AMOUNTS PER SHARE (Continued)  Amounts       Per Share of Common and Class B Stock  The       calculation of diluted income per share of Common Stock and Class B Stock takes       into account the effect of obligations, such as stock options and convertible       securities, considered to be potentially dilutive. Basic and diluted       income/(loss) per share were calculated using the following number of shares       (in       millions):            2005     2004     2003       Basic                 and Diluted Income/(Loss)                         Basic                 income/(loss) from continuing operations attributable to Common Stock                 and                 Class B Stock     $   2,228     $   3,633     $   902       Effect                 of dilutive convertible preferred securities       213       199       —       Diluted                 income/(loss) from continuing operations attributable to Common Stock                 and                 Class B Stock     $   2,441     $   3,832     $   902       Diluted                 Shares                         Average                 shares outstanding       1,846       1,830       1,832       Restricted                 and uncommitted-ESOP shares       (3   )     (4   )     (2   )     Basic                 shares       1,843       1,826       1,830       Net                 dilutive options and restricted and uncommitted ESOP                 shares       10       18       13       Dilutive                 convertible preferred securities *       282       282       —       Diluted                 shares       2,135       2,126       1,843       __________ *        In       2003,       not included in calculation of diluted earnings per share due to their       antidilutive effect are 282 million shares and the related income effect for       convertible preferred securities.   NOTE       19. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION   We       have       been recording employee compensation expense in net income since January 1,       2003       under the provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting       for Stock-Based Compensation. Effective       December 31, 2005, we adopted the provisions of SFAS 123R, Share-Based       Payment       under       the modified prospective method. This statement will be applied to new awards       in       2006 and to any awards that are modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the       date of adoption.   We       continue to measure the fair value of our stock-based compensation using the       Black-Scholes option-pricing model, using historical volatility and the       simplified method of calculating the expected term. Our expected term is       calculated by averaging the vesting term (3 years) and the contractual term       of       the option (10 years). Historical data is also used to estimate option exercise        behaviors       and employee termination experience within the valuation model. Based on our       assessment of employee groupings and observable behaviors, we determined that       a       single grouping is appropriate. We expense compensation cost for stock options       using a three year cliff vesting methodology. Shares needed for stock based       compensation are issued from treasury stock. We expect to repurchase 26 million       shares for treasury stock during 2006.  At       December 31, 2005, Ford has outstanding a variety of stock-based compensation       to       employees (including Officers and members of the Board of Directors). All       stock-based compensation plans are approved by the shareholders.  Description       of Stock Option Plans  We       have       stock options outstanding under two Long-term Incentive Plans ("LTIP"), the       1990       LTIP and the 1998 LTIP. No further grants may be made under the 1990 LTIP and       all outstanding options under this plan are exercisable. All outstanding options       under the 1990 LTIP continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of       the       existing option agreements for those grants. Grants may continue to be made       under the 1998 LTIP through April 2008. Under the 1998 LTIP, 33% of the options       are generally exercisable after the first anniversary of the date of grant,       66%       after the second anniversary, and 100% after the third anniversary. Stock       options expire ten years from the grant date.   Under       the       1998 LTIP, 2% of our issued Common Stock as of December 31 becomes available       for       granting plan awards in the succeeding calendar year. Any unused portion is       available for later years. The limit may be increased up to 3% in       any       year, with a corresponding reduction in shares available for grants in future       years. At December 31, 2005, the number of unused shares carried forward       aggregated to 79.6 million shares.

The       total       fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004,       and       2003, was $145 million, $184 million, and $206 million, respectively.       We have 191.9 million fully vested stock options with a weighted-average       exercise price of $20.61 and remaining term of 4.4 years. We expect 52.3 million       stock options (after forfeitures) with a weighted-average exercise price of       $11.95 and remaining term of 8.5 years to vest in the future. The aggregate       intrinsic value of these options is $2.8 million and $1.7 million,       respectively.   We       received $33.2 million from the exercise of stock options in 2005. The tax       benefit realized was $3.1 million. An       equivalent of $42.2 million in treasury shares were used to settle       exercised options. For options exercised during the years ended December 31,       2005, 2004 and 2003, the difference between the fair value of the common shares       issued and their respective exercise price was $9.0 million,       $47.7 million, and $3.5 million, respectively. Compensation cost for       2005, 2004, and 2003 was $92.7 million, $77.4 million, and       $112.1 million net of tax of $23.3 million, $41.6 million, and       $60.4 million, respectively.   As       of       December 31, 2005, there is $50.9 million in unrealized compensation cost       related to non-vested stock options. This expense will be recognized over a       weighted-average period of 1.3 years.

These awards       include Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Equivalents, Performance Stock       Rights, Performance-based Restricted Stock Equivalents, and Stock Appreciation       Rights. These awards have various vesting criteria including service       requirements, individual performance targets, and company-wide performance       targets.   Other       share-based compensation expense was $29.8 million for 2005,       $7.6 million for 2004, and $46.2 million for 2003.    NOTE       20. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  All       derivative instruments, including embedded derivatives, are recorded at fair       value on our balance sheet.  Our       operations are exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes       in foreign currency exchange rates, certain commodity prices and interest rates.       The objective of our risk management program is to manage the financial and       operational exposure arising from these risks by offsetting gains and losses       on       the underlying exposures with gains and losses on derivatives used to hedge       them. We have hedge documentation that defines the hedging objectives,       practices, procedures, and accounting treatment. Our hedging program and our       derivative positions and strategy are reviewed on a regular basis by our       management.  We       have       elected to apply hedge accounting to a portion of our derivatives. Hedges that       receive designated hedge accounting treatment are evaluated for effectiveness       at       the time they are designated as well as throughout the hedge period. Some       derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting; for others, we elect not to       apply hedge accounting treatment. For both of these, the mark to fair value       is       reported currently through earnings.   The       use       of derivatives to manage market risk results in counterparty risk, or the risk       of a counterparty defaulting on a derivative contract. We enter into master       netting agreements with counterparties that usually allow for netting of certain       exposures. We establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk       and provide counterparty diversification. Substantially all our counterparty       exposures are with counterparties that have long-term debt ratings of single-A       or better.  Automotive       Sector  Cash       Flow Hedges. We       use       forward contracts and options, which qualify as cash flow hedges, to manage       our       exposure to foreign currency exchange and commodity price risks. The effective       portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges is deferred in Accumulated       other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”)       and is recognized in Cost       of sales when       the       hedged item affects earnings.  Derivatives       used to manage financial exposures for foreign exchange and commodity price       risks generally mature within three years or less, with a maximum maturity       of       five years. Cash flow hedges are discontinued when it is probable that the       original forecasted transaction will not occur. The impact to earnings       associated with hedge ineffectiveness from cash flow hedges was recorded in       Cost       of sales as       a loss       of $1 million in 2005, a gain of $1 million in 2004 and a gain of $36 million       in       2003.         FS-32          FORD             MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES             TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       NOTE       20. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued)   Net       Investment Hedges. We       use       foreign currency contracts to hedge the net assets of certain foreign entities       to offset the translation and economic exposures related to our investment       in       these entities. The change in the value of these derivatives is recorded in       OCI       as a foreign currency translation adjustment. The ineffectiveness related to       net       investment hedges is recorded in Cost       of sales.       Gains       of $20 million, losses of $2 million, and gains of $95 million were recorded       in       2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.  Other       Derivative Instruments. As       previously stated, some derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting       treatment or we elect not to apply hedge accounting. In such cases, both the       gains and losses are reported in Cost       of sales       or       Interest Income and other non-operating income/(expense), net. The       earnings impact primarily relates to the revaluation of foreign currency       derivatives, which are substantially offset by the revaluation on foreign       denominated debt, and warrants.  Financial       Services Sector  Ford       Credit’s overall risk management objective is to maximize financing income while       limiting the effect of changes in foreign currencies and interest rates. Ford       Credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between       the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those       receivables. Ford Credit executes cross-currency swaps and foreign currency       forwards to convert substantially all of the foreign currency debt obligations       to the local currency of the receivables. Interest rate swaps are used to manage       exposure to re-pricing risk, which arises when assets and the debt funding       those       assets have different re-pricing periods that consequently respond differently       to interest rate changes. Regardless of hedge accounting treatment, derivative       positions are used only to manage identified exposures.  Cash       Flow Hedges. Ford       Credit designates certain interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges to manage       the       cash flow fluctuations of floating-rate debt due to the changes in market       interest rates. The impact to earnings associated with hedge ineffectiveness       was       recognized in Revenues       as       a loss       of $43 million and a gain of $12 million and $3 million in 2005,       2004 and 2003, respectively. In assessing hedge effectiveness for cash flow       hedges related to interest rates, Ford Credit uses the variability of cash       flows       method and excludes accrued interest. Net interest settlements and accruals       excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness were expenses of       $71 million, $354 million and $482 million in 2005, 2004, and       2003, respectively, and recorded in Interest       expense.       While       net interest settlements and accruals are excluded from hedge effectiveness       testing, they are included in evaluating the overall risk management       objective.  Fair       Value Hedges. Ford       Credit designates certain interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps as fair       value hedges to manage the fair value fluctuations of fixed-rate debt due to       the       changes in market interest rates. Unrealized gains and losses related to       derivatives in fair value hedges, along with changes in the fair value of the       underlying hedged exposure are recognized and recorded in Revenues.       The       impact to earnings from hedge ineffectiveness was a loss of $1 million and       a gain of $10 million and $255 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,       respectively. In assessing hedge effectiveness, Ford Credit excludes accrued       interest on the receive and pay legs of the swaps. Net interest settlements       and       accrual income of $1.1 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion in 2005,       2004 and 2003, respectively, were recorded as a reduction in Interest       expense.       Ford       Credit also excludes from the assessment of hedge effectiveness foreign exchange       adjustments, representing the portion of the derivative’s fair value       attributable to the change in foreign currency exchange rates for the reporting       period, which were unfavorable adjustments totaling $365 million in 2005       and favorable adjustments totaling $384 million and $1.3 billion in       2004 and 2003, respectively. While net settlements and foreign currency       adjustments are excluded from Ford Credit’s hedge effectiveness testing, they       are included in evaluating       the overall risk management objective. The adjustments related to the foreign       currency derivatives reported above were offset by revaluation impacts on debt       denominated in a currency other than the location’s functional currency, which       was also recorded in Revenues.  Net       Investment Hedges. Ford       Credit uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options to hedge       the       net assets of certain foreign entities to offset the translation and economic       exposures related to its investment in foreign entities. Changes in the value       of       these derivatives are recorded in OCI as a foreign currency translation       adjustment. Ineffectiveness, which is recognized in Revenues,       were       losses of $13 million, $29 million and $17 million in 2005, 2004,       and 2003, respectively.  Other       Derivative Instruments. As       previously stated, some derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting       treatment or Ford Credit elects not to apply hedge accounting. In such cases,       both the gains and losses are recorded in Revenues.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued)  impact       primarily relates to interest rate swaps, which are included in evaluating       Ford       Credit's overall risk management objective, and the revaluation of foreign       currency derivatives, which are substantially offset by the revaluation on       foreign denominated debt.   Total       Company  Summary       of OCI Activity. The       following table summarizes activity in OCI excluding foreign currency       translation adjustments on net investment hedges for both the Automotive and       Financial Services sectors during the years ended December 31       (in millions):            2005     2004     2003       Beginning                 of year: net unrealized gain/(loss) on derivative financial                 instruments     $   1,240     $   1,302     $   313       Increase/(decrease)                 in fair value of derivatives       (661   )     961       1,072       (Gains)/losses                 reclassified from OCI       (553   )     (1,023   )     (83   )     End                 of year: net unrealized gain/(loss) on derivative financial                 instruments     $   26     $   1,240     $   1,302        We       expect       to reclassify for Automotive and Financial Services sectors existing net gains       of $71 million from OCI to net income during the next twelve months as the       underlying exposures are realized.  Fair       Value of Derivative Instruments. The       fair       value of derivatives reflects the price that a third party would be willing       to       pay or receive in arm’s length transactions and includes mark-to-market       adjustments to reflect the effects of changes in the related index.

EXIT AND DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES AND OTHER ACTIONS   Automotive       Sector  Exit       and disposal activities. In       2004,       we announced the PAG Improvement Plan including hourly and salaried employee       separation programs and the planned closure of assembly operations at our Browns       Lane facility. Associated with these actions, we recognized a pre-tax charge       (excluding pension costs) of $64 million in 2004 and approximately       $35 million at December 31, 2005, of which $5 million was       incurred in the fourth quarter 2005. The plan is expected to be completed in       2006.  In       2003,       we initiated planned shift pattern changes at our Genk vehicle assembly plant       and manufacturing, engineering and staff efficiency actions in Cologne and       various United Kingdom locations. Associated with these actions, we recognized       pre-tax charge of $486 million in 2003 and $92 million in 2004. These       actions are expected to be completed in several years.  The       charges for employee separation actions were recognized in Cost       of sales.       The       table below summarizes the pre-tax charges incurred in 2005 for the employee       separation actions described above, the related liability at December 31, 2005       and the estimated total charges related to these actions (in       millions):          Segment     Liability                 at December                 31, 2004       Accrued                 in 2005       Paid                 in 2005         Other*     Liability                 at December                 31, 2005       Estimated Total                 Costs       Ford                 Europe and PAG     $   139     $   35     $   (122   )   $   (40   )   $   12     $   774       __________ *       Includes foreign currency translation adjustments and reductions to accrued       amounts resulting from revisions to estimated liabilities.  Other       Employee Separation Actions. In       the       second quarter of 2005, we announced our plans to reduce salaried positions       in       our Ford North America business unit. We have incurred approximately $148       million of pre-tax charges related to these actions through December 31, 2005,       of which approximately $65 million was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2005.       In addition, approximately $88 million of pre-tax charges were incurred in       the       fourth quarter for hourly separations of which approximately $62 million was       related to ACH.  During       the third quarter of 2005, our Ford Europe and PAG segment initiated hourly       and       salaried employee separation actions resulting in pre-tax charges of       approximately $360 million, of which approximately $334 million was incurred       in       the fourth quarter.  During       the fourth quarter of 2005, our Ford Asia Pacific and Africa business unit       initiated hourly and salaried employee separation actions resulting in pre-tax       charges of approximately $32 million.  See       Note       23 for employee separation costs related to pension, postretirement health       care       and life insurance benefits.

EXIT AND DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES AND OTHER ACTIONS       (Continued)  Financial       Services Sector  Exit       and disposal activities. In       2004,       we announced a plan to create an integrated sales platform in the United States       and Canada over the next two years that would support sales activities for       Ford       Credit and our other business operating units. The plan included the       consolidation of regional sales offices and an integration of branch locations.       We recognized pre-tax charges related to the plan of $41 million in 2005       and $11 million in 2004 in Operating       expenses.       The       integration will be completed in 2006.  The       table       below summarizes the pre-tax charges incurred, the related liability at December       31 and the estimated total costs for the sales branch integration:          Segment     Liability                 at December                 31, 2004       Accrued                 in 2005       Paid                 in 2005         Other     Liability                 at December                 31, 2005       Estimated Total                 Costs       Ford                 Credit     $   10     $   41     $   (36   )   $   —     $   15     $   61        Other       Employee Separation Actions. In       2005,       we completed various separation programs for Ford Credit salaried employees       in       connection with reorganization and efficiency actions. We recognized pre-tax       charges of $36 million in 2005 as a result of these actions (excluding       costs for retirement plan and postretirement health care and life insurance       benefits).   NOTE       23. RETIREMENT BENEFITS  Employee       Retirement and Savings Plans  We       have       two principal qualified defined benefit retirement plans in the United States.       The Ford-UAW Retirement Plan covers hourly employees represented by the UAW,       and       the General Retirement Plan covers substantially all other Ford employees in       the       United States hired on or before December 31, 2003. The hourly plan provides       noncontributory benefits related to employee service. The salaried plan provides       similar noncontributory benefits and contributory benefits related to pay and       service. Other U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries have separate plans that generally       provide similar types of benefits for their employees. We established, effective       January 1, 2004, a defined contribution plan generally covering new salaried       U.S. employees hired on or after that date. Ford-UAW Retirement Plan expense       accruals for UAW-represented Ford employees previously assigned to Visteon       Corporation (“Visteon Hourly Employees”) were charged to Visteon Corporation       (“Visteon”). Pursuant to definitive agreements with Visteon signed on       September 12, 2005, these charges were discontinued effective October 1,       2005.   For       our       plans that provide benefits based on salary, we project employee future salary       growth for such salary-related benefits. Certain of our defined benefit pension       plans provide benefits that are not based on salary (e.g., U.S. Ford-UAW       Retirement Plan, noncontributory portion of the U.S. General Retirement Plan,       and Canada Ford-UAW Retirement Plan). The salary growth assumption is not       applicable to these benefits.  Plan       obligations and costs are based on existing retirement plan provisions. No       assumption is made regarding any potential future changes to benefit provisions       beyond those to which we are presently committed (e.g., in existing labor       contracts).  In       general, our plans are funded, with the main exceptions of certain plans in       Germany and U.S. defined benefit plans for senior management. In such cases,       an       unfunded liability is recorded.  The       expense for our worldwide defined contribution plans was $83 million in       2005, $80 million in 2004 and $37 million in 2003. This includes the       expense for company matching contributions to our primary savings plans (United       States and Canada) of $44 million in 2005, $40 million in 2004 and       $0 million in 2003. The 2004 increase in savings plan expense was due to       reinstatement of company matching contribution on salaried employee       contributions in the United States and Canada. The company match was suspended       again in July 2005.          FS-36          FORD             MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES             TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       NOTE       23. RETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued)  Postretirement       Health Care and Life Insurance Benefits  We,       and       certain of our subsidiaries, sponsor plans to provide selected health care       and       life insurance benefits for retired employees. The Ford UAW       Hospital-Surgical-Medical-Drug-Dental-Vision Program covers hourly employees       represented by the UAW, and the Ford Salary Health Care Plan covers       substantially all other Ford employees in the United States hired before       June 1, 2001. We also offer company-paid postretirement life insurance       benefits to U.S. salary employees hired before January 1, 2004 and all       U.S. hourly employees. Our employees generally may become eligible for benefits       when they retire; however, benefits and eligibility rules may be modified from       time to time.   In       December 2003, we announced a new postretirement health care plan for U.S.       salary employees hired on or after June 1, 2001. The plan provides for       annual company allocations to employee-specific notional accounts to be used       to       fund postretirement health care benefits.    Effective       January 1, 2007 for U.S. salaried employees hired before June 1, 2001       we established a company contribution limit set at 2006 levels for retiree       health care benefits. U.S. salaried employees hired on or after June 1, 2001       participate in a defined contribution retiree health care plan. In addition,       for       U.S. salaried employees hired before January 1, 2004 who retire on or after       June 1, 2006, company-paid retiree life insurance benefits are limited       to $50,000 (employees hired on or after January 1, 2004 do not receive       company-paid life insurance benefits). These benefit changes resulted in a       decrease in the year-end 2005 other postretirement employee benefit ("OPEB")       obligation of about $3 billion.  In       December 2005, we reached an agreement with the UAW that would increase retiree       health care cost sharing. As part of the agreement, an independent defined       contribution Voluntary Employee Benefit Association trust would be established       for the purpose of mitigating the financial impact of increased cost sharing       to       retirees. This trust would be funded primarily through (i) wage diversions       from       active hourly employees, (ii) specified cash contributions aggregating $108       million to be made by us over several years,       and       (iii) potential cash contributions to be made by us based on any price       appreciation above $8.145 per share of a notional amount of 8,750,000 shares       of       Ford Common Stock. The agreement is subject to court approval of a proposed       settlement of a purported class action challenging our decision to modify the       retiree health care plan; additional retirees have expressed their objection       to       the agreement by moving to intervene in the pending lawsuit and filing a       follow-on suit of their own.   In       2003,       we agreed to relieve Visteon of its responsibility for the OPEB liability       related to service prior to our spinoff of Visteon at June 30, 2000 for the       Visteon Hourly Employees. This resulted in a one-time charge to expense in       2003       of $1.6 billion, and the forgiveness of associated Visteon promissory notes       previously included in plan assets. Pursuant to this agreement, the expense       associated with service after June 30, 2000 for Visteon Hourly Employees was       charged to Visteon. OPEB expense for former salaried Ford employees who       transferred to Visteon and met certain age and service conditions at June 30,       2000 was also charged to Visteon.   In       2005,       an agreement was reached with Visteon which included forgiving a receivable       related to Visteon's remaining UAW OPEB obligation and a portion of Visteon's       salary obligation for former Ford employees and retirees. The total receivable       forgiven was about $800 million, of which $600 million was recorded in 2004       as an allowance for doubtful receivables. At December 31, 2005, we had       a long-term receivable of $140 million representing Visteon’s remaining       responsibility for the benefits of the Visteon salaried employees. For       additional discussion of this agreement, see Note 4.  On       December 8, 2003, the President signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug       Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. The law provides for a federal       subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit       at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by the law. We       provide retiree drug benefits that exceed the value of the benefits that will       be       provided by Medicare Part D, and our retirees’ out-of-pocket costs are less than       they would be under Medicare Part D. Therefore, we have concluded that our       plan       is at least “actuarially equivalent” to the Medicare Part D plan and that we       will be eligible for the subsidy. We have reflected the impact of the subsidy       by       reducing our 2005 and 2004 expense by $290 million and $250 million,       respectively.

The actual retiree health       care cost trend for 2005 was 2%, primarily reflecting  lower       than expected drug costs and continued administrative efficiencies (e.g.,       competitive sourcing and pricing). The actual retiree health care cost trend       for       2004 was 9%.  Plan       Contributions   Our       policy for funded plans is to contribute annually, at a minimum, amounts       required by applicable laws, regulations, and union agreements. We do from       time       to time make contributions beyond those legally required.  Pension.       In       2005,       we made $2.5 billion of cash contributions to our funded pension plans. During       2006, we expect to contribute $1.5 billion to our worldwide pension plans,       including about $300 million of benefit payments paid directly by us for       unfunded plans. Based on current assumptions and regulations, we do not expect       to have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. pension plans in 2006.   Health       Care and Life Insurance. In       2005,       we contributed $200 million to our previously established VEBA for U.S. hourly       retiree health care and life insurance benefits. During 2006, we do not expect       to contribute to the VEBA.  Estimated       Future Benefit Payments  The       following table presents estimated future gross benefit payments and subsidy       receipts related to the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization       Act of 2003 (in millions):      Plan       Asset Information  Pension.       Our       investment strategy for pension assets has a long-term horizon and is tolerant       of return volatility, in keeping with the long-term nature of the liabilities.       The target asset allocation for our major plans worldwide generally is 70%       equities, 30% fixed income. The present allocation to alternative investments       (e.g., private equity) is below 1%. All assets are externally managed and most       investment managers have discretion to invest globally within their respective       mandates. A diverse array of investment processes within asset classes reduces       volatility. Most assets are actively managed; manager skill and broad mandates       have generally produced long-term returns in excess of common market indices.       Ford securities comprised less than five percent of the total market value       of       our assets in major worldwide plans (including U.S., U.K., Canada, Germany,       Sweden, Netherlands, Belgium, and Australia) during 2005 and 2004.  Investment       managers are permitted to use derivatives as efficient substitutes for       traditional securities and to manage exposure to foreign exchange and interest       rate risks. Interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments are used       for the purpose of hedging changes in the fair value of assets that result       from       interest rate changes and currency fluctuations. Derivatives may not be used       to       leverage or to alter the economic exposure to an asset class outside the scope       of the mandate to which an investment manager has been appointed.  The       equity allocation shown at year-end 2005 and 2004 includes public equity       securities, private equity investments, and REITS. Direct real estate       investments shown separately reflect a liquidation strategy that has been in       place for several years. Other assets include cash held for near-term benefit       funding; cash held by investment managers for liquidity purposes is included       in       the appropriate asset class balance.         FS-40          FORD             MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES             TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       NOTE       23. RETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued)  The       long-term return assumption at year-end 2005 is 8.50% for U.S. plans, 8.00%       for       U.K. plans and averages 7.78% for non-U.S. plans. A generally consistent       approach is used worldwide to develop this assumption. This approach considers       various inputs, including a review of historical plan returns and long-run       inputs from a range of internal and external advisors for capital market       returns, inflation, bond yields and other variables, adjusted for specific       aspects of our investment strategy. We also consider peer data in setting the       external return on asset assumption.  At       December 31, 2005, our actual 10-year annual rate of return on pension plan       assets was 9.79% and 8.33% for U.S. and the U.K. plans, respectively. At       December 31, 2004, our actual 10-year annual rate of return on pension plan       assets was 11.20% and 8.41% for U.S. and the U.K. plans,       respectively.  Health       Care and Life Insurance. VEBA       assets totaling $6.5 billion at December 31, 2005 include $6.0 billion of       long-term investments, which are managed in a strategy similar to the pension       investment strategy described previously. The remaining VEBA assets are invested       in short-term fixed income securities, a portion of which is managed internally,       with the remainder managed externally. Ford securities comprised less than       five       percent of the market value of the total retiree VEBA assets during 2005 and       2004.  Investment       managers are permitted to use derivatives as efficient substitutes for       traditional securities and to manage exposure to foreign exchange and interest       rate risks. Interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments are used       for the purpose of hedging changes in the fair value of assets that result       from       interest rate changes and currency fluctuations. Derivatives may not be used       to       leverage or to alter the economic exposure to an asset class outside the scope       of the mandate to which an investment manager has been appointed.  The       equity allocation shown at year-end 2005 includes public equity securities       and       REITS. There were no investments in private equity or direct real estate       investments at year-end 2005. Cash held by investment managers for liquidity       purposes is included in the appropriate asset class balance.  The       expected return assumption applicable to the total retiree VEBA is 8.28%,       reflecting the weighted average of the expected returns on the long-term and       short-term portions of the portfolio. Since the assets in the long-term portion       of the portfolio are managed in a strategy similar to the U.S. pension plan,       the       expected return on this portion of the portfolio is identical to that used       for       the U.S. pension plan. The expected return assumption for the short-term portion       of the portfolio reflects the three month LIBOR rate consistent with our plan       to       draw down the short-term VEBA by the second quarter in 2006.   NOTE       24. SEGMENT INFORMATION  Our       operating activity consists of two operating sectors, Automotive and Financial       Services. Segment selection is based on the organizational structure we use       to       evaluate performance and make decisions on resource allocation, as well as       availability and materiality of separate financial results consistent with       that       structure.  The       Americas segment includes primarily the sale of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand       vehicles and related service parts in North America (U.S., Canada and Mexico)       and Ford-brand vehicles and related service parts in South America; in each       case, together with the associated costs to design, develop, manufacture and       service these vehicles and parts.  The       Ford       Europe and PAG segment includes primarily the sale of Ford-brand vehicles and       related service parts in Europe and Turkey and the sale of PAG-brand vehicles       (i.e., Volvo, Jaguar, Land Rover and Aston Martin) and related service parts       throughout the world (including North America and South America); in each case,       together with the associated costs to design, develop, manufacture and service       these vehicles and parts.

SEGMENT INFORMATION (Continued)  The       Asia       Pacific and Africa/Mazda segment includes primarily the sale of Ford-brand       vehicles and related service parts in the Asia Pacific region and South Africa,       together with the associated costs to design, develop, manufacture and service       these vehicles and parts, and also includes our share of the results of Mazda       and certain of our Mazda-related investments.  The       Other       Automotive component of the Automotive sector consists primarily of certain       centrally managed net interest expense, which is not managed individually by       the       three segments.  Transactions       among Automotive segments are presented on an absolute cost basis, eliminating       the effect of legal entity transfer prices within the Automotive sector for       vehicles, components and product engineering.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  Lease       Commitments  We       lease       land, buildings and equipment under agreements that expire in various years.       Minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases were as follows       (in millions):      Rental       expense was $1.5 billion in 2005, $1.5 billion in 2004 and $1.4 billion in       2003.         FS-44          FORD             MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES             TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       NOTE       27. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)  Guarantees  The       fair       values of guarantees and indemnifications during 2005 and 2004 are recorded       in       the financial statements. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the following       guarantees and indemnifications were issued and outstanding:  Guarantees       related to affiliates and third parties. We       guarantee debt and lease obligations of certain joint ventures as well as       certain financial obligations of outside third parties to support business       and       economic growth. Expiration dates vary, and guarantees will terminate on payment       and/or cancellation of the obligation. A payment would be triggered by failure       of the guaranteed party to fulfill its obligation covered by the guarantee.       In       some circumstances, we are entitled to recover from the third party amounts       paid       by us under the guarantee. However, our ability to enforce these rights is       sometimes stayed until the guaranteed party is paid in full. The maximum       potential payments under these guarantees total approximately $113 million       for       2005 and were $471 million for 2004, the majority of which relates to the       Automotive sector.  On       December 21, 2005, we completed the sale of Hertz. As part of the transaction,       we provided cash-collateralized letters of credit in an aggregate amount of       $200       million to support the asset-backed portion of the buyer's financing for the       transaction. Our commitment to provide the letters of credit expires no later       than December 21, 2011 and supports the payment obligations of Hertz Vehicle       Finance LLC under one or more series of asset-backed notes ("asset-backed       notes"). The letters of credit can be drawn upon on any date funds allocated       to       pay interest on the asset-backed notes are insufficient to pay scheduled       interest payments, principal amounts due on the legal final maturity date,       or       when the balance of assets supporting the asset-backed notes is less than the       outstanding balance of the asset-backed notes. During the fourth quarter of       2005, we recognized a liability of $27 million which represents the       estimated fair value of our obligation under the letters of credit.  In       1996,       we issued $500 million of 7.25% Notes due October 1, 2008. In 1999, we defeased       our obligation as primary obligor with respect to the principal of these notes.       As part of this transaction, we placed certain financial assets into an escrow       trust for the benefit of the noteholders, and the trust became the primary       obligor with respect to the principal (we became secondarily liable for the       entire principal amount).  We       also       have guarantees outstanding associated with a subsidiary trust, Trust II. For       further discussion of Trust II, see Notes 16 and 18.  Indemnifications.       In       the       ordinary course of business, we execute contracts involving indemnifications       standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction, such       as       the sale of a business. These indemnifications might include claims against       any       of the following: environmental, tax, and shareholder matters; intellectual       property rights; power generation contracts; governmental regulations and       employment-related matters; dealer, supplier, and other commercial contractual       relationships; and financial matters, such as securitizations. Performance       under       these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the       contract or by a third-party claim. We regularly evaluate the probability of       having to incur costs associated with these indemnifications and have accrued       for expected losses that are probable. We are party to numerous indemnifications       and many of these indemnities do not limit potential payment; therefore, we       are       unable to estimate a maximum amount of potential future payments that could       result from claims made under these indemnities.  Product       Performance  Warranty.       Estimated       warranty costs and additional service actions are accrued for at the time the       vehicle is sold to a dealer. Included in the warranty cost accruals are costs       for basic warranty coverages on vehicles sold. Additional service actions such       as product recalls and other customer service actions are not included in the       warranty reconciliation below, but are also accrued for at          FS-45          FORD             MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES             TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS       NOTE       27. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)  the       time       of sale. Estimates for warranty costs are made based primarily on historical       warranty claim experience. The following is a tabular reconciliation of the       product warranty accrual (in millions):             2005     2004       Beginning                 balance     $   5,751     $   5,443       Payments                 made during the year       (3,986   )     (3,694   )     Changes                 in accrual related to warranties issued during the year       3,949       3,611       Changes                 in accrual related to pre-existing warranties       593       161       Foreign                 currency translation and other       (149   )     230       Ending                 balance     $   6,158     $   5,751        Extended       Service Plans. Fees       or       premiums for the issuance of extended service plans are recognized in income       over the contract period in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred       in       performing services under the contract.  Litigation       and Claims  Various       legal actions, governmental investigations and proceedings and claims are       pending or may be instituted or asserted in the future against us, including       those arising out of alleged defects in our products; governmental regulations       relating to safety, emissions and fuel economy; financial services;       employment-related matters; dealer, supplier and other contractual       relationships; intellectual property rights; product warranties; environmental       matters; shareholder or investor matters; and financial reporting matters.       Certain of the pending legal actions are, or purport to be, class actions.       Some       of the foregoing matters involve or may involve compensatory, punitive, or       antitrust or other treble damage claims in very large amounts, or demands for       recall campaigns, environmental remediation programs, sanctions, or other       relief, which, if granted, would require very large expenditures.  Litigation       is subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual litigated       matters is not predictable with assurance. We have established accruals for       certain of the matters discussed in the foregoing paragraph where losses are       deemed probable and reasonably estimable. It is reasonably possible, however,       that some of the matters discussed in the foregoing paragraph for which accruals       have not been established could be decided unfavorably to us and could require       us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts or a range of amounts       that cannot be estimated at December 31, 2005. We do not reasonably expect,       based on our analysis, that such matters would have a material effect on future       financial statements for a particular year, although such an outcome is       possible.  Conditional       Asset Retirement Obligations  In       March       2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards issued Interpretation No. 47       ("FIN 47"), Accounting       for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations.       Under       FIN 47, companies must accrue for costs related to legal obligations to perform       certain activities in connection with the retirement, disposal or abandonment       of       assets. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not       conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional.   We       have       identified asbestos abatement and PCB removal as conditional asset retirement       obligations. Asbestos abatement was estimated using site-specific surveys where       available and a per/square foot estimate where surveys were unavailable. PCB       removal costs were based on historical removal costs per transformer and applied       to transformers identified by a PCB transformer global survey we conducted.       Other conditional asset retirement obligations exist, including regulated       substances. These costs, however, are not estimable until a triggering event       occurs (e.g., plant closing) due to the absence of historical cost, range of       potential settlement dates and variability among plants. Presently the company       does not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of this       obligation.  FIN       47       requires that the estimate be recorded as a liability and as an increase to       the       asset. The capitalized portion is depreciated over the "remaining useful life       of       the asset". We believe the most reasonable "remaining useful life" should be       consistent with our depreciation       policy. Therefore, the full amount was expensed at December 31, 2005, as an       after-tax charge of $251 million shown as a Cumulative       effects of changes in accounting principles.          FS-46           FORD               MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES               TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS        REPORT       OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To       the       Board of Directors and Stockholders  Ford       Motor Company:  We       have       completed integrated audits of Ford Motor Company’s 2005 and 2004 consolidated       financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as       of       December 31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003 consolidated financial statements       in       accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board       (United States). Our opinions,       based on       our audits, are presented below.  Consolidated       financial       statements  In       our       opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related       consolidated statements of income, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows       present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ford Motor       Company and its subsidiaries at       December 31, 2005 and       2004,       and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three       years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting       principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial       statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our       responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based       on       our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with       the       standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).       Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable       assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material       misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test       basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial       statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates       made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.       We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our       opinion.  Our       audit       was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial       statements taken as a whole. The accompanying sector balance sheets and the       related sector statements of income and of cash flows is presented for purposes       of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic financial       statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures       applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion,       is       fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial       statements taken as a whole.  As       discussed in Note 17 to the financial statements, on July 1, 2003, the Company       adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51”.       As discussed in Note 27 to the financial statements, in the fourth quarter       of       2005, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation       No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an       interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143”.  Internal       control over financial reporting  Also,       in       our opinion, management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on       Internal Control Over Financial Reporting under Item 9A, that the Company       maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December       31, 2005 based       on       criteria established in Internal       Control - Integrated Framework       issued       by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO),       is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.       Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,       effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,       based on criteria established in Internal       Control - Integrated Framework       issued       by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective       internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the       effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility       is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of       the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We       conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance       with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United       States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain       reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial       reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control       over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control       over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and       evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and       performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances.       We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.   A       company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to       provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting       and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance       with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over       financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain       to       the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly       reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)       provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to       permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted       accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the                FS-47                   company         are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and         directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding         prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition         of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial         statements.   Because         of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may         not         prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of         effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may         become         inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance         with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  As         described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in         this Annual Report, management has excluded Automotive Component’s Holdings, LLC         (“ACH”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of         December 31, 2005 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business         combination during 2005. We have also excluded ACH from our audit of internal         control over financial reporting. ACH is a subsidiary controlled and managed         by         Ford whose total assets and total revenues represent less than 1% of         the corresponding consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for         the year ended December 31, 2005.   /s/         PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP PricewaterhouseCoopers         LLP Detroit,         Michigan March         1,         2006            FS-48               FORD       MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES  Schedule       II — Valuation and Qualifying Accounts (in       millions)          Description     Balance                 at Beginning of                 Period      Charged                 to Costs                 and Expenses          Deductions      Balance                 at    End                 of                    Period        For                 the Year Ended December 31, 2005                               Allowances                 Deducted from Assets                                                 Allowance for Credit Losses     $   2,471     $   167     $   1,044   (a)   $   1,594                         Allowance for Doubtful Receivables       988       523   (b)     1,194   (c)     317   (d)                       Inventories (primarily service part obsolescence)       376       52   (e)     —       428                         Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets       169       79       —       248       Total                 Allowances Deducted from Assets     $   4,004     $   821     $   2,238     $   2,587                                     For                 the Year Ended December 31, 2004                               Allowances                 Deducted from Assets                                                 Allowance for Credit Losses     $   2,962     $   923     $   1,414   (a)   $   2,471                         Allowance for Doubtful Receivables       384       663   (b)     59   (c)     988   (d)                       Inventories (primarily service part obsolescence)       368       8   (e)     —       376                         Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets       106       63       —       169       Total                 Allowances Deducted from Assets     $   3,820     $   1,657     $   1,473     $   4,004                                     For                 the Year Ended December 31, 2003                               Allowances                 Deducted from Assets                                                 Allowance for Credit Losses     $   3,054     $   1,928     $   2,020   (a)   $   2,962                         Allowance for Doubtful Receivables       374       108       98   (c)     384                         Inventories (primarily service part obsolescence)       304       64   (e)     —       368                         Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets       50       56       —       106       Total                 Allowances Deducted from Assets     $   3,782     $   2,156     $   2,118     $   3,820       __________ (a) Finance       receivables and lease investments deemed to be uncollectible and other changes,       principally amounts related to finance receivables sold and translation       adjustments.
