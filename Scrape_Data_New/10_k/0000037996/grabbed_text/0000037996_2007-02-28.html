DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS &#151; LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES&#148;. A DISCUSSION OF FORD CREDIT&#146;S MARKET RISKS IS INCLUDED BELOW. </DIV> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;<I>FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. </I>TO MEET FUNDING OBJECTIVES, FORD CREDIT ISSUES DEBT OR, FOR ITS INTERNATIONAL AFFILIATES, DRAWS ON LOCAL CREDIT LINES IN A VARIETY OF CURRENCIES. FORD CREDIT FACES EXPOSURE TO CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES IF A MISMATCH EXISTS BETWEEN THE CURRENCY OF ITS RECEIVABLES AND THE CURRENCY OF THE DEBT FUNDING THOSE RECEIVABLES. WHEN POSSIBLE, RECEIVABLES ARE FUNDED WITH DEBT IN THE SAME CURRENCY, MINIMIZING EXPOSURE TO EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS. WHEN A DIFFERENT CURRENCY IS USED, FORD CREDIT SEEKS TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES BY EXECUTING FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVES. THESE DERIVATIVES CONVERT SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY DEBT OBLIGATIONS TO THE LOCAL COUNTRY CURRENCY OF THE RECEIVABLES. AS A RESULT, FORD CREDIT&#146;S MARKET RISK EXPOSURE RELATING TO CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IS BELIEVED TO BE IMMATERIAL. </DIV> <P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT"><!-- FOLIO -->70<!-- /FOLIO --> </DIV> <!-- PAGEBREAK --> <P><HR NOSHADE><P> <H5 ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:ALWAYS"><A HREF="#TOCPAGE">TABLE OF CONTENTS</A></H5><P> <DIV STYLE="FONT-FAMILY: HELVETICA,ARIAL,SANS-SERIF"> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 12PT"><I>ITEM 7A.

AN INSTRUMENT&#146;S RE-PRICING PERIOD IS A TERM USED BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO DESCRIBE HOW AN INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE INSTRUMENT RESPONDS TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. IT REFERS TO THE TIME IT TAKES AN INSTRUMENT&#146;S INTEREST RATE TO REFLECT A CHANGE IN MARKET INTEREST RATES. FOR FIXED-RATE INSTRUMENTS, THE RE-PRICING PERIOD IS EQUAL TO THE MATURITY FOR REPAYMENT OF THE INSTRUMENT&#146;S PRINCIPAL BECAUSE, WITH A FIXED INTEREST RATE, THE PRINCIPAL IS CONSIDERED TO RE-PRICE ONLY WHEN RE-INVESTED IN A NEW INSTRUMENT. FOR A FLOATING-RATE INSTRUMENT, THE RE-PRICING PERIOD IS THE PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE THE INTEREST RATE ADJUSTS TO THE MARKET RATE. FOR INSTANCE, A FLOATING-RATE LOAN WHOSE INTEREST RATE IS RESET TO A MARKET INDEX ANNUALLY ON DECEMBER&NBSP;31 WOULD HAVE A RE-PRICING PERIOD OF ONE YEAR ON JANUARY&NBSP;1, REGARDLESS OF THE INSTRUMENT&#146;S MATURITY. </DIV> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;FORD CREDIT&#146;S RECEIVABLES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FIXED-RATE RETAIL INSTALLMENT SALE AND LEASE CONTRACTS AND FLOATING-RATE WHOLESALE RECEIVABLES. FIXED-RATE RETAIL INSTALLMENT SALE AND LEASE CONTRACTS ARE ORIGINATED PRINCIPALLY WITH MATURITIES RANGING BETWEEN TWO AND SIX YEARS AND GENERALLY REQUIRE CUSTOMERS TO MAKE EQUAL MONTHLY PAYMENTS OVER THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACT. WHOLESALE RECEIVABLES ARE ORIGINATED TO FINANCE NEW AND USED VEHICLES HELD IN DEALERS&#146; INVENTORY AND GENERALLY REQUIRE DEALERS TO PAY A FLOATING RATE. FORD CREDIT&#146;S FUNDING SOURCES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF SECURITIZATIONS AND SHORT- AND LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT. IN THE CASE OF UNSECURED TERM DEBT, AND IN AN EFFORT TO HAVE FUNDS AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE BUSINESS CYCLE, FORD CREDIT MAY ISSUE DEBT WITH FIVE- TO TEN-YEAR MATURITIES, WHICH IS GENERALLY LONGER THAN THE TERMS OF ITS ASSETS. THESE DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE PRINCIPALLY FIXED-RATE AND REQUIRE FIXED AND EQUAL INTEREST PAYMENTS OVER THE LIFE OF THE INSTRUMENT AND A SINGLE PRINCIPAL PAYMENT AT MATURITY. </DIV> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;FORD CREDIT IS EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK TO THE EXTENT THAT A DIFFERENCE EXISTS BETWEEN THE RE-PRICING PROFILE OF ITS ASSETS AND DEBT. SPECIFICALLY, WITHOUT DERIVATIVES, FORD CREDIT&#146;S ASSETS WOULD RE-PRICE MORE QUICKLY THAN ITS DEBT. </DIV> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;FORD CREDIT&#146;S INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE IS TO MAXIMIZE ITS ECONOMIC VALUE WHILE LIMITING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. FORD CREDIT ACHIEVES THIS OBJECTIVE BY SETTING AN ESTABLISHED RISK TOLERANCE AND STAYING WITHIN THIS TOLERANCE THROUGH THE FOLLOWING RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS: </DIV> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;FORD CREDIT DETERMINES THE SENSITIVITY OF THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF ITS PORTFOLIO OF INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (ITS ECONOMIC VALUE) TO HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. ECONOMIC VALUE IS A MEASURE OF THE PRESENT VALUE OF ALL FUTURE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS, DISCOUNTED BY MARKET INTEREST RATES, AND IS EQUAL TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE ASSETS MINUS THE PRESENT VALUE OF INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE LIABILITIES. FORD CREDIT THEN ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS, TO ECONOMICALLY CONVERT PORTIONS OF ITS FLOATING-RATE DEBT TO FIXED OR ITS FIXED-RATE DEBT TO FLOATING, TO ENSURE THAT THE SENSITIVITY OF ITS ECONOMIC VALUE FALLS WITHIN AN ESTABLISHED TOLERANCE. FORD CREDIT ALSO MONITORS ITS PRE-TAX CASH FLOW SENSITIVITY OVER A TWELVE-MONTH HORIZON USING SIMULATION TECHNIQUES. THIS SIMULATION DETERMINES THE SENSITIVITY OF CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RE-PRICING CHARACTERISTICS OF INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND DERIVATIVES UNDER VARIOUS HYPOTHETICAL INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS INCLUDING BOTH PARALLEL AND NON-PARALLEL SHIFTS IN THE YIELD CURVE. THIS SENSITIVITY CALCULATION DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ANY FUTURE ACTIONS FORD CREDIT MAY TAKE TO REDUCE THE RISK PROFILE THAT ARISES FROM A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES. THESE QUANTIFICATIONS OF INTEREST RATE RISK ARE REPORTED TO OUR TREASURER REGULARLY (EITHER MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY DEPENDENT ON THE MARKET). </DIV> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;THE PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE IS USED TO MEASURE AND MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK OF FORD CREDIT&#146;S OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, WHICH TOGETHER REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 79% OF ITS TOTAL ON-BALANCE SHEET FINANCE RECEIVABLES AT DECEMBER&NBSP;31, 2006. FOR ITS OTHER INTERNATIONAL AFFILIATES, FORD CREDIT USES A TECHNIQUE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS &#147;GAP ANALYSIS,&#148; TO MEASURE RE-PRICING MISMATCH. THIS PROCESS USES RE-PRICING SCHEDULES, WHICH GROUP ASSETS, DEBT AND SWAPS INTO DISCRETE TIME BANDS BASED ON THEIR RE-PRICING CHARACTERISTICS. UNDER THIS PROCESS, FORD CREDIT ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS, WHICH EFFECTIVELY CHANGE THE RE-PRICING PROFILE OF ITS DEBT, TO ENSURE THAT ANY RE-PRICING MISMATCH (BETWEEN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES) EXISTING IN A PARTICULAR TIME BAND FALLS WITHIN AN ESTABLISHED TOLERANCE. </DIV> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;AS A RESULT OF ITS INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS, FORD CREDIT&#146;S DEBT, COMBINED WITH THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ECONOMICALLY HEDGING ITS DEBT, RE-PRICES FASTER THAN ITS ASSETS. OTHER THINGS EQUAL, THIS MEANS THAT DURING A PERIOD OF RISING INTEREST RATES, THE INTEREST RATES PAID ON FORD CREDIT&#146;S DEBT WILL INCREASE MORE RAPIDLY THAN THE INTEREST RATES EARNED ON ITS ASSETS, THEREBY INITIALLY REDUCING FORD CREDIT&#146;S PRE-TAX CASH FLOW. CORRESPONDINGLY, DURING A PERIOD OF FALLING INTEREST RATES, FORD CREDIT&#146;S PRE-TAX CASH FLOW WOULD BE EXPECTED TO INITIALLY INCREASE. TO PROVIDE A QUANTITATIVE MEASURE OF THE SENSITIVITY OF ITS PRE-TAX CASH FLOW TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, FORD CREDIT USES INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS THAT ASSUME A HYPOTHETICAL, INSTANTANEOUS INCREASE OR DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES OF ONE PERCENTAGE POINT ACROSS ALL MATURITIES (A &#147;PARALLEL </DIV> <P ALIGN="CENTER" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT"><!-- FOLIO -->71<!-- /FOLIO --> </DIV> <!-- PAGEBREAK --> <P><HR NOSHADE><P> <H5 ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE:ALWAYS"><A HREF="#TOCPAGE">TABLE OF CONTENTS</A></H5><P> <DIV STYLE="FONT-FAMILY: HELVETICA,ARIAL,SANS-SERIF"> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 12PT"><I>ITEM 7A.

THIS CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE RESULTS OF NORMAL FLUCTUATIONS WITHIN THE APPROVED TOLERANCES OF RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. WHILE THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS PRESENTED IS FORD CREDIT&#146;S BEST ESTIMATE OF THE IMPACTS OF SPECIFIED ASSUMED INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS, THE MODEL FORD CREDIT USES FOR THIS ANALYSIS IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON ASSUMPTIONS, SO THAT ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE PROJECTED. EMBEDDED IN THE MODEL FORD CREDIT USES ARE ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE REINVESTMENT OF MATURING ASSET PRINCIPAL, REFINANCING OF MATURING DEBT, AND PREDICTED REPAYMENT OF RETAIL INSTALLMENT SALE AND LEASE CONTRACTS AHEAD OF CONTRACTUAL MATURITY. FORD CREDIT&#146;S REPAYMENT PROJECTIONS OF RETAIL INSTALLMENT SALE AND LEASE CONTRACTS AHEAD OF CONTRACTUAL MATURITY ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. IF INTEREST RATES OR OTHER FACTORS WERE TO CHANGE, THE ACTUAL PREPAYMENT EXPERIENCE COULD BE DIFFERENT THAN PROJECTED. </DIV> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;ADDITIONALLY, INTEREST RATE CHANGES OF ONE PERCENTAGE POINT OR MORE ARE RARELY INSTANTANEOUS OR PARALLEL, AND RATES COULD MOVE MORE OR LESS THAN THE ONE PERCENTAGE POINT ASSUMED IN FORD CREDIT&#146;S ANALYSIS. AS A RESULT, THE ACTUAL IMPACT TO PRE-TAX CASH FLOW COULD BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE RESULTS DETAILED ABOVE. THE MODEL USED TO CONDUCT THIS ANALYSIS ALSO RELIES HEAVILY ON ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE REINVESTMENT OF MATURING ASSET PRINCIPAL, REFINANCING OF MATURING DEBT, AND PREDICTED REPAYMENT OF SALE AND LEASE CONTRACTS AHEAD OF CONTRACTUAL MATURITY. </DIV> <DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;THE FAIR VALUE OF FORD CREDIT&#146;S NET DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (DERIVATIVE ASSETS LESS DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES) AS REPORTED IN NOTE 22 OF THE NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER&NBSP;31, 2006 WAS $1.5&NBSP;BILLION COMPARED WITH $1.9&NBSP;BILLION AT DECEMBER&NBSP;31, 2005. THE DECREASE IN FAIR VALUE REFLECTS PRIMARILY MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM HIGHER INTEREST RATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY TRANSLATION GAINS RESULTING FROM THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE EURO AND THE BRITISH POUND.
