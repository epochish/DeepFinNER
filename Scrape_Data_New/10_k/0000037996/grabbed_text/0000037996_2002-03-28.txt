ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) WITH THE AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR INCURRING SIGNIFICANT LOSSES AND THE FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR PROVIDING OFFSETTING PROFITS. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT THE OPERATING RELATED CHANGES IN GROSS CASH FOR THE AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR (CALCULATED ON THE BASIS DESCRIBED UNDER "LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR - GROSS CASH) TO BE NEGATIVE IN 2002. SIMILAR TO THE IMPROVEMENTS IN COST AND THE OTHER EXPECTED BENEFITS OF THE REVITALIZATION PLAN, WE EXPECT TO ACHIEVE MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENTS IN SUCH OPERATING CASH FLOW BY MID-DECADE. 2002 FINANCIAL MILESTONES ------------------------- WE HAVE SET AND COMMUNICATED CERTAIN FINANCIAL MILESTONES FOR 2002. WHILE WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, THEY SHOULD NOT BE INTERPRETED AS PROJECTIONS, EXPECTATIONS OR FORECASTS OF 2002 RESULTS. THE FINANCIAL MILESTONES FOR 2002 ARE AS FOLLOWS: <TABLE> <CAPTION> RESTRUCTURING PRIORITIES 2002 MILESTONE ------------------------ -------------- <S> <C> COMMUNICATE/IMPLEMENT PLANS REPORT ON PROGRESS QUALITY (U.S.) IMPROVE J.D.

THESE STATEMENTS INVOLVE A NUMBER OF RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, AND OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE STATED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION: INCREASING PRICE COMPETITION IN THE U.S. AND EUROPE RESULTING FROM INDUSTRY OVERCAPACITY, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OR OTHER FACTORS; A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN INDUSTRY SALES, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES OR EUROPE, RESULTING FROM SLOWING ECONOMIC GROWTH OR OTHER FACTORS; LOWER-THAN-ANTICIPATED MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR NEW OR EXISTING PRODUCTS; CURRENCY OR COMMODITY PRICE FLUCTUATIONS; AVAILABILITY OF FUEL; A MARKET SHIFT FROM TRUCK SALES IN THE UNITED STATES; LOWER-THAN-ANTICIPATED RESIDUAL VALUES FOR LEASED VEHICLES; A CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADE, LABOR OR OTHER CONSTRAINTS ON OUR ABILITY TO RESTRUCTURE OUR BUSINESS; INCREASED SAFETY, EMISSIONS, FUEL ECONOMY OR OTHER REGULATION RESULTING IN HIGHER COSTS AND/OR SALES RESTRICTIONS; WORK STOPPAGES AT KEY FORD OR SUPPLIER FACILITIES OR OTHER INTERRUPTIONS OF SUPPLIES; THE DISCOVERY OF DEFECTS IN VEHICLES RESULTING IN DELAYS IN NEW MODEL LAUNCHES, RECALL CAMPAIGNS, INCREASED WARRANTY COSTS OR LITIGATION; INSUFFICIENT CREDIT LOSS RESERVES; AND OUR INABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THE REVITALIZATION PLAN. 57 <PAGE> ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK -------------------------------------------------------------------- OVERVIEW WE ARE EXPOSED TO A VARIETY OF MARKET AND OTHER RISKS, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, COMMODITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES, AS WELL AS RISKS TO AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING SOURCES, HAZARD EVENTS, AND SPECIFIC ASSET RISKS. THESE RISKS AFFECT OUR AUTOMOTIVE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTORS DIFFERENTLY. WE MONITOR AND MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR OVERALL RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, WHICH INCLUDES REGULAR REPORTS TO A CENTRAL MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE THAT OVERSEES GLOBAL RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM RECOGNIZES THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF MARKETS AND SEEKS TO REDUCE PROFIT VOLATILITY. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THESE FINANCIAL EXPOSURES, SEE NOTES 1 AND 14 OF THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. OUR AUTOMOTIVE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTORS ALSO ARE EXPOSED TO LIQUIDITY RISK, OR THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING TO CURTAIL THEIR BUSINESSES OR BEING UNABLE TO MEET PRESENT AND FUTURE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AS THEY COME DUE BECAUSE FUNDING SOURCES MAY BE REDUCED OR BECOME UNAVAILABLE. WE, AND PARTICULARLY FORD CREDIT, WHICH COMPRISES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR, MAINTAIN PLANS FOR SOURCES OF FUNDING TO ENSURE LIQUIDITY THROUGH ANY ECONOMIC OR BUSINESS CYCLE. AS DISCUSSED IN GREATER DETAIL IN ITEM 7, OUR FUNDING SOURCES INCLUDE COMMERCIAL PAPER, TERM DEBT, SALE OF RECEIVABLES THROUGH SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS, COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT FROM MAJOR BANKS, AND OTHER SOURCES. WE ALSO ARE EXPOSED TO A VARIETY OF INSURABLE RISKS, SUCH AS LOSS OR DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, LIABILITY CLAIMS, AND EMPLOYEE INJURY. WE PROTECT AGAINST THESE RISKS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF SELF INSURANCE AND THE PURCHASE OF COMMERCIAL INSURANCE DESIGNED TO PROTECT AGAINST EVENTS THAT COULD GENERATE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES. THE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISKS OF OUR AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR AND FORD CREDIT ARE DISCUSSED AND QUANTIFIED BELOW. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK OUR AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR FREQUENTLY HAS EXPENDITURES AND RECEIPTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: PURCHASES AND SALES OF FINISHED VEHICLES AND PRODUCTION PARTS, DEBT AND OTHER PAYABLES, SUBSIDIARY DIVIDENDS, AND INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES. THESE EXPENDITURES AND RECEIPTS CREATE EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES. WE ALSO ARE EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN PRICES OF COMMODITIES USED IN OUR AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK --------------------- FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE BETTER OR WORSE THAN PLANNED BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES. WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND FIRM COMMITMENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. OUR HEDGING POLICY IS DESIGNED TO REDUCE INCOME VOLATILITY AND IS BASED ON CLEARLY DEFINED GUIDELINES. SPECULATIVE ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. IN OUR HEDGING ACTIONS, WE USE PRIMARILY INSTRUMENTS COMMONLY USED BY CORPORATIONS TO REDUCE FOREIGN EXCHANGE, INTEREST RATE AND OTHER PRICE RISKS (E.G., FORWARD CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND INTEREST RATE SWAPS). WE USE A VALUE-AT-RISK ("VAR") ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE OUR EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE PRIMARY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE VAR ANALYSIS ARE AS FOLLOWS: O A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION MODEL IS USED TO CALCULATE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF CURRENCY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS (E.G., FORWARDS AND OPTIONS) AND ALL SIGNIFICANT UNDERLYING EXPOSURES. THE VAR ANALYSIS INCLUDES AN 18-MONTH EXPOSURE AND DERIVATIVE HEDGING HORIZON AND A ONE-MONTH HOLDING PERIOD. 58 <PAGE> ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (CONTINUED) O THE VAR ANALYSIS CALCULATES THE POTENTIAL RISK, WITHIN A 99% CONFIDENCE LEVEL, ON CROSS-BORDER CURRENCY CASH FLOW EXPOSURES, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVES. (TRANSLATION EXPOSURES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE VAR ANALYSIS). THE MONTE CARLO SIMULATION MODEL USES HISTORICAL VOLATILITY AND CORRELATION ESTIMATES OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS TO PRODUCE A LARGE NUMBER OF FUTURE PRICE SCENARIOS, WHICH HAVE A STATISTICALLY LOGNORMAL DISTRIBUTION. O ESTIMATES OF CORRELATIONS AND VOLATILITIES ARE DRAWN PRIMARILY FROM THE RISKMETRICSTM DATASETS. HEDGING ACTIONS SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE OUR RISK TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY RATES. BASED ON OUR OVERALL CURRENCY EXPOSURE (INCLUDING DERIVATIVE POSITIONS) DURING 2001, THE RISK DURING 2001 TO OUR PRE-TAX CASH FLOW FROM CURRENCY MOVEMENTS WAS ON AVERAGE $300 MILLION, WITH A HIGH OF $350 MILLION AND A LOW OF $275 MILLION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2001, CURRENCY MOVEMENTS ARE PROJECTED TO AFFECT OUR PRE-TAX CASH FLOW OVER THE NEXT 18 MONTHS BY LESS THAN $275 MILLION, WITHIN A 99% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. COMPARED WITH OUR PROJECTION AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, THE 2001 VAR AMOUNT IS APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION LOWER, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF DECREASED CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY. COMMODITY PRICE RISK -------------------- COMMODITY PRICE RISK IS THE POSSIBILITY OF HIGHER OR LOWER COSTS DUE TO CHANGES IN THE PRICES OF COMMODITIES, SUCH AS NON-FERROUS (E.G., ALUMINUM) AND PRECIOUS METALS (E.G., PALLADIUM, PLATINUM AND RHODIUM), FERROUS ALLOYS (E.G., STEEL), ENERGY (E.G., NATURAL GAS) AND PLASTICS (E.G., POLYPROPYLENE), WHICH WE USE IN THE PRODUCTION OF MOTOR VEHICLES. WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE THE PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE OF THOSE COMMODITIES THAT WE CAN ECONOMICALLY HEDGE. THE FAIR VALUE LIABILITY OF SUCH CONTRACTS, EXCLUDING THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000 WAS APPROXIMATELY A NEGATIVE $259 MILLION AND A POSITIVE $56 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE POTENTIAL CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF COMMODITY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS, ASSUMING A 10% CHANGE IN THE UNDERLYING COMMODITY PRICE, WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY $267 MILLION AND $280 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. THIS AMOUNT EXCLUDES THE OFFSETTING IMPACT OF THE PRICE CHANGE WE WOULD EXPERIENCE IN PURCHASING THE UNDERLYING COMMODITIES. IN ADDITION TO THESE PRICE-HEDGING ACTIVITIES, OUR PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF RAW MATERIALS USED IN OUR BUSINESS. THESE PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES UTILIZE FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACTS, LONG-TERM SUPPLY CONTRACTS AND STOCKPILES. THE $1 BILLION PRE-TAX WRITE-DOWN OF PRECIOUS METALS, DISCUSSED IN NOTE 16 OF THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, RELATED TO THESE PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS WRITE-DOWN, WE MODIFIED OUR PROCESSES SO THAT ANY PRICE-HEDGING INHERENT IN OUR PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES IS EXECUTED BY OR COORDINATED WITH OUR TREASURER'S OFFICE, WHICH MANAGES OUR PRICE-HEDGING ACTIVITY. OUR PRICE-HEDGING POLICY IS BASED ON CLEARLY DEFINED GUIDELINES. SPECULATIVE ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. IN 2001, WE ENHANCED OUR RISK EVALUATION TO INCLUDE A VAR ANALYSIS, USING HISTORICAL VOLATILITIES, TO EVALUATE OUR EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES GIVEN OUR FINANCIAL HEDGES, FORWARD PROCUREMENT AND SUPPLY CONTRACTS ON THOSE COMMODITIES WHICH WE HEDGE. BASED ON OUR COMMODITY EXPOSURE AND RELATED HEDGING ACTIVITY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2001, COMMODITY PRICE MOVEMENTS ARE PROJECTED TO AFFECT OUR PRE-TAX CASH FLOW OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS BY UP TO $167 MILLION, WITHIN A 99% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. OVER THE LAST YEAR THE VAR MEASUREMENTS AVERAGED $339 MILLION, WITH A HIGH OF $625 MILLION AND A LOW OF $167 MILLION. THESE RISK LEVELS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN THEY WOULD OTHERWISE BE WITHOUT HEDGING ACTIONS. COUNTERPARTY RISK ----------------- COUNTERPARTY RISK RELATES TO THE LOSS WE COULD INCUR IF A COUNTERPARTY DEFAULTED ON AN INVESTMENT OR A DERIVATIVE CONTRACT. EXPOSURES MANAGED ARE FINANCIAL AND PRIMARILY RELATE TO INVESTMENTS IN FIXED-INCOME PRODUCTS AND DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF MANAGING INTEREST RATE, CURRENCY AND COMMODITY RISK. WE, TOGETHER WITH FORD CREDIT, ESTABLISH EXPOSURE LIMITS FOR EACH COUNTERPARTY TO 59 <PAGE> ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (CONTINUED) MINIMIZE RISK AND PROVIDE COUNTERPARTY DIVERSIFICATION. EXPOSURES ARE MONITORED ON A REGULAR BASIS. OUR APPROACH TO MANAGING COUNTERPARTY RISK IS FORWARD-LOOKING AND PROACTIVE, ALLOWING US TO TAKE RISK MITIGATION ACTIONS. EXPOSURE LIMITS ARE ESTABLISHED FOR BOTH MARK-TO-MARKET AND FUTURE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE, BASED ON OUR OVERALL RISK TOLERANCE AND RATINGS-BASED HISTORICAL DEFAULT PROBABILITIES. A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION TECHNIQUE IS UTILIZED TO GENERATE THE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE BY TENOR, WITHIN A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL (MARKET CONVENTION). ESTIMATES OF CORRELATIONS AND VOLATILITIES ARE DRAWN FROM RISKMETRICSTM DATASETS. FORD CREDIT MARKET AND OTHER RISKS OVERVIEW -------- FORD CREDIT IS EXPOSED TO RISKS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION TO COUNTERPARTY RISK DISCUSSED ABOVE, FORD CREDIT IS SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL TYPES OF RISKS THAT IT SEEKS TO IDENTIFY, ASSESS, MONITOR AND MANAGE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH DEFINED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES: O CREDIT RISK - THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSS FROM A CUSTOMER'S FAILURE TO MAKE PAYMENTS ACCORDING TO CONTRACT TERMS. O RESIDUAL RISK - THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ACTUAL PROCEEDS RECEIVED BY FORD CREDIT UPON THE SALE OF RETURNED LEASE VEHICLES AT LEASE TERMINATION WILL BE LOWER THAN ITS INTERNAL FORECAST OF RESIDUAL VALUES. O MARKET RISK - THE POSSIBILITY THAT CHANGES IN FUTURE MARKET INTEREST AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OR PRICES WILL MAKE FORD CREDIT'S POSITIONS LESS VALUABLE. O LIQUIDITY RISK - THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING UNABLE TO MEET ALL CURRENT AND FUTURE OBLIGATIONS IN A TIMELY MANNER. O OPERATING RISK - THE POSSIBILITY OF ERRORS RELATING TO TRANSACTION PROCESSING AND SYSTEMS, ACTIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCIES WITH REGULATORY STANDARDS OR FRAUD BY FORD CREDIT'S OWN EMPLOYEES OR OUTSIDE PERSONS. EACH FORM OF RISK IS UNIQUELY MANAGED IN THE CONTEXT OF ITS CONTRIBUTION TO FORD CREDIT'S OVERALL GLOBAL RISK. BUSINESS DECISIONS ARE EVALUATED ON A RISK-ADJUSTED BASIS AND PRODUCTS ARE PRICED CONSISTENT WITH THESE RISKS. SEE FORD MOTOR CREDIT COMPANY'S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM-10 K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THIS SUBJECT. CREDIT RISK ----------- FORD CREDIT EXTENDS CONSUMER CREDIT BY PURCHASING RETAIL VEHICLE INSTALLMENT SALE AND LEASE CONTRACTS FROM VEHICLE DEALERS. THESE CONTRACTS ARE DIVIDED INTO SEGMENTS BY CREDIT RISK TIER, TERM AND WHETHER THE VEHICLE FINANCED OR LEASED IS NEW OR USED. SEGMENT DATA ARE USED TO ENSURE THAT PRICING AND SERVICING PROCEDURES ARE COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH EACH CONTRACT. FORD CREDIT HAS BEHAVIORAL MODELS TO ASSIST IN DETERMINING THE BEST COLLECTION STRATEGIES. IN GENERAL, COLLECTION PROCEDURES ARE DESIGNED TO KEEP ACCOUNTS CURRENT AND TO COLLECT ON DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS. AS A FINAL STEP, AFTER REASONABLE COLLECTION EFFORTS HAVE FAILED, VEHICLES ARE REPOSSESSED; HOWEVER, COLLECTION EFFORTS OF ANY REMAINING BALANCE CONTINUE UNTIL THE ACCOUNT IS PAID IN FULL OR DETERMINED TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE. FORD CREDIT ALSO EXTENDS NON-CONSUMER LOANS, WHICH INCLUDE WHOLESALE AND OTHER LOANS TO DEALERS AS WELL AS AUTOMOTIVE FINANCING FOR COMMERCIAL ENTITIES. TO MONITOR CREDIT PERFORMANCE, FORD CREDIT REQUIRES DEALERS TO SUBMIT MONTHLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PERFORMS PERIODIC PHYSICAL AUDITS OF VEHICLES (WITH MORE FREQUENT AUDITS FOR HIGHER RISK DEALERS), AND MONITORS INVENTORY PAYOFFS DAILY TO DETECT ADVERSE DEVIATIONS FROM TYPICAL PAYOFF PATTERNS, IN WHICH CASE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS ARE TAKEN. 60 <PAGE> ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (CONTINUED) RESIDUAL RISK ------------- FORD CREDIT'S LEASE CONTRACTS ARE WRITTEN WITH VEHICLE LEASE-END VALUES THAT APPROXIMATE RESIDUAL VALUES PUBLISHED IN AUTOMOTIVE LEASING GUIDE. FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, HOWEVER, FORD CREDIT SETS THE INTERNAL VALUE OF EXPECTED RESIDUAL VALUES (NET OF COSTS) BASED ON A PROPRIETARY ECONOMETRIC MODEL THAT USES HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND FORWARD LOOKING INFORMATION SUCH AS NEW PRODUCT PLANS, MARKETING PROGRAMS AND QUALITY METRICS. ANY UNFAVORABLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CUSTOMER CONTRACT LEASE-END VALUE AND FORD CREDIT'S INTERNAL FORECAST IS ACCRUED AND EXPENSED AS DEPRECIATION. FORD CREDIT REVIEWS THE DEPRECIATION RATES ON LEASED VEHICLES QUARTERLY AND ADJUSTS THEM AS NEEDED TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE PROJECTED RESIDUAL VALUES. AT LEASE TERMINATION, FORD CREDIT MAXIMIZES RESIDUAL PROCEEDS THROUGH THE USE OF MODELS TO DETERMINE WHICH GEOGRAPHIC MARKET WOULD YIELD THE HIGHEST RESALE VALUE, NET OF TRANSPORTATION COST. SOMETIMES, LEASE EXTENSIONS OR EARLY TERMINATIONS ARE OFFERED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SEASONAL RESALE PATTERNS. MARKET RISK ----------- THE GOAL OF FINANCIAL MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT IS TO REDUCE THE PROFIT VOLATILITY EFFECT OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. FORD CREDIT USES VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, PARTICULARLY INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS TO MANAGE MARKET RISK. FORD CREDIT IS EXCLUSIVELY AN END USER OF THESE INSTRUMENTS, WHICH ARE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS DERIVATIVES; AND, DOES NOT ENGAGE IN ANY TRADING, MARKET-MAKING OR OTHER SPECULATIVE ACTIVITIES IN THE DERIVATIVE MARKETS. SINCE FORD CREDIT'S PRINCIPAL USE OF DERIVATIVES IS TO ELIMINATE MISMATCHES BETWEEN THE TERMS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND EXCHANGE RATES WOULD HAVE GENERALLY OFFSETTING EFFECTS ON THE VALUE OF FORD CREDIT'S FINANCIAL ASSETS AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND, THEREFORE, WOULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON FORD CREDIT'S FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR INSTANCE, ASSUMING AN INSTANTANEOUS INCREASE OF ONE PERCENTAGE POINT IN INTEREST RATES APPLIED TO ALL FINANCIAL ASSETS, DEBT AND HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, FORD CREDIT'S AFTER-TAX EARNINGS WOULD DECLINE BY $66 MILLION OVER THE ENSUING TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD. LIQUIDITY RISK -------------- ONE OF FORD CREDIT'S MAJOR OBJECTIVES IS TO MAINTAIN FUNDING AVAILABILITY THROUGH ANY ECONOMIC OR BUSINESS CYCLE. FORD CREDIT FOCUSES ON DEVELOPING FUNDING SOURCES TO SUPPORT GROWTH AND REFINANCING OF MATURING DEBT. FORD CREDIT ALSO ISSUES DEBT THAT, ON AVERAGE, MATURES LATER THAN ASSETS LIQUIDATE, FURTHER ENHANCING OVERALL LIQUIDITY. GLOBAL FUNDING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE THE DIRECT AND DEALER-PLACED COMMERCIAL PAPER, THE PLACEMENT OF TERM DEBT TO RETAIL AND INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SALE OF RECEIVABLES. FORD CREDIT'S ABILITY TO RAISE FUNDS AT A COMPETITIVE COST IS LINKED TO ITS DEBT RATINGS. MANAGEMENT CLOSELY MONITORS THE AMOUNT OF SHORT-TERM FUNDING AND MIX OF SHORT-TERM FUNDING TO TOTAL DEBT, THE OVERALL COMPOSITION OF TOTAL DEBT AND THE AVAILABILITY OF COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES IN RELATION TO THE LEVEL OF OUTSTANDING SHORT-TERM DEBT. STRESS TESTING OF FORD CREDIT'S LIQUIDITY POSITION IS CONDUCTED PERIODICALLY. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF FORD CREDIT'S FUNDING SOURCES AND DEBT RATINGS, SEE ITEM 7. "MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES." 61 <PAGE> ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (CONTINUED) OPERATING RISK -------------- FORD CREDIT OPERATES IN MANY LOCATIONS AND RELIES ON THE ABILITIES OF ITS EMPLOYEES AND SYSTEMS TO PROCESS A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS. IMPROPER OPERATION OF SYSTEMS OR IMPROPER EMPLOYEE ACTIONS COULD RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSS, REGULATORY ACTION AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION. TO ADDRESS THIS RISK, WE AND FORD CREDIT MAINTAIN INTERNAL CONTROL PROCESSES THAT IDENTIFY TRANSACTION AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS, SAFEGUARD ASSETS FROM MISUSE OR THEFT, AND ENSURE THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA. WE ALSO MAINTAIN SYSTEM CONTROLS TO MAINTAIN THE ACCURACY OF INFORMATION ABOUT OUR OPERATIONS. THESE CONTROLS ARE DESIGNED TO MANAGE OPERATING RISK THROUGHOUT OUR OPERATIONS.
