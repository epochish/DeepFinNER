ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES. PURSUANT TO OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH THE UAW, UNDER WHICH MOST OF OUR U.S. HOURLY EMPLOYEES ARE COVERED, WE ARE CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED TO PROVIDE SPECIFIED LEVELS OF PENSION AND HEALTH CARE BENEFITS TO BOTH EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES COVERED BY THE CONTRACT. THESE OBLIGATIONS GIVE RISE TO SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES THAT ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON ASSUMPTIONS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 20 OF THE NOTES TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND UNDER "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES" ABOVE. BASED ON PRESENT ASSUMPTIONS AND BENEFIT AGREEMENTS, WE EXPECT OUR 2003 U.S. PRE-TAX PENSION EXPENSE TO BE ABOUT $270 MILLION, WHICH IS ABOUT $460 MILLION HIGHER THAN IT WAS IN 2002. IN 2002, OUR HEALTH CARE COSTS FOR UNITED STATES EMPLOYEES WAS $2.8 BILLION, WITH ABOUT $1.9 BILLION ATTRIBUTABLE TO RETIREES AND $900 MILLION ATTRIBUTABLE TO ACTIVE EMPLOYEES. OUR HEALTH CARE COSTS IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN RISING AT ABOUT 16% A YEAR OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, WHICH ROSE ABOUT 15% IN 2002 COMPARED WITH 2001, IS THE FASTEST GROWING SEGMENT OF OUR HEALTH CARE COSTS AND NOW ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 30% OF OUR TOTAL UNITED STATES HEALTH CARE COSTS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE TAKEN MEASURES TO HAVE SALARIED EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES BEAR A HIGHER PORTION OF THE COSTS OF THEIR HEALTH CARE BENEFITS, WE EXPECT THESE TRENDS TO CONTINUE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. RISK FACTORS ------------ STATEMENTS INCLUDED OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN MAY CONSTITUTE "FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS" WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. THESE STATEMENTS INVOLVE A NUMBER OF RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, AND OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE STATED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION: O GREATER PRICE COMPETITION IN THE U.S. AND EUROPE RESULTING FROM CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, INDUSTRY OVERCAPACITY OR OTHER FACTORS; O A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN INDUSTRY SALES, PARTICULARLY IN THE U.S. OR EUROPE, RESULTING FROM SLOWING ECONOMIC GROWTH, GEO-POLITICAL EVENTS OR OTHER FACTORS; O LOWER-THAN-ANTICIPATED MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW OR EXISTING PRODUCTS; O WORK STOPPAGES AT KEY FORD OR SUPPLIER FACILITIES OR OTHER INTERRUPTIONS OF SUPPLIES; O THE DISCOVERY OF DEFECTS IN VEHICLES RESULTING IN DELAYS IN NEW MODEL LAUNCHES, RECALL CAMPAIGNS OR INCREASED WARRANTY COSTS; O INCREASED SAFETY, EMISSIONS, FUEL ECONOMY OR OTHER REGULATION RESULTING IN HIGHER COSTS AND/OR SALES RESTRICTIONS; O UNUSUAL OR SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION OR GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS ARISING OUT OF ALLEGED DEFECTS IN OUR PRODUCTS OR OTHERWISE; O WORSE-THAN-ASSUMED ECONOMIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC EXPERIENCE FOR OUR POST RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS (E.G., INVESTMENT RETURNS, INTEREST RATES, HEALTH CARE COST TRENDS, BENEFIT IMPROVEMENTS); O CURRENCY OR COMMODITY PRICE FLUCTUATIONS; O A MARKET SHIFT FROM TRUCK SALES IN THE U.S.; O ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES IN SOUTH AMERICA OR ASIA; O REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF OR HIGHER PRICES FOR FUEL; O LABOR OR OTHER CONSTRAINTS ON OUR ABILITY TO RESTRUCTURE OUR BUSINESS; O A CHANGE IN OUR REQUIREMENTS UNDER LONG-TERM SUPPLY ARRANGEMENTS UNDER WHICH WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PURCHASE MINIMUM QUANTITIES OR PAY MINIMUM AMOUNTS; O A FURTHER CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADE; O INABILITY TO ACCESS DEBT OR SECURITIZATION MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD AT COMPETITIVE RATES OR IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS; O HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES; O LOWER-THAN-ANTICIPATED RESIDUAL VALUES FOR LEASED VEHICLES; O INCREASED PRICE COMPETITION IN THE RENTAL CAR INDUSTRY AND/OR A GENERAL DECLINE IN BUSINESS OR LEISURE TRAVEL DUE TO TERRORIST ATTACKS, ACT OF WAR OR MEASURES TAKEN BY GOVERNMENTS IN RESPONSE THERETO THAT NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY; AND O OUR INABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THE REVITALIZATION PLAN. 64 <PAGE> ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK -------------------------------------------------------------------- OVERVIEW WE ARE EXPOSED TO A VARIETY OF MARKET AND OTHER RISKS, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, COMMODITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES, AS WELL AS RISKS TO AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING SOURCES, HAZARD EVENTS, AND SPECIFIC ASSET RISKS. THESE RISKS AFFECT OUR AUTOMOTIVE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTORS DIFFERENTLY. WE MONITOR AND MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR OVERALL RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, WHICH INCLUDES REGULAR REPORTS TO A CENTRAL MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE, THE GLOBAL RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE ("GRMC"). THE GRMC IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING OUR OVERALL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND REVIEWING PERFORMANCE AGAINST THESE OBJECTIVES. THE GRMC IS CHAIRED BY OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, AND ITS MEMBERS INCLUDE OUR TREASURER, OUR CONTROLLER, AND THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF FORD CREDIT. OUR AUTOMOTIVE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTORS ARE EXPOSED TO LIQUIDITY RISK, OR THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING TO CURTAIL THEIR BUSINESSES OR BEING UNABLE TO MEET PRESENT AND FUTURE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AS THEY COME DUE BECAUSE FUNDING SOURCES MAY BE REDUCED OR BECOME UNAVAILABLE. WE, AND PARTICULARLY FORD CREDIT, WHICH COMPRISES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR, MAINTAIN PLANS FOR SOURCES OF FUNDING TO ENSURE LIQUIDITY THROUGH A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC OR BUSINESS CYCLES. AS DISCUSSED IN GREATER DETAIL IN ITEM 7, OUR FUNDING SOURCES INCLUDE COMMERCIAL PAPER, TERM DEBT, SALE OF RECEIVABLES THROUGH SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS, COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT FROM MAJOR BANKS, AND OTHER SOURCES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO A VARIETY OF INSURABLE RISKS, SUCH AS LOSS OR DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, LIABILITY CLAIMS, AND EMPLOYEE INJURY. WE PROTECT AGAINST THESE RISKS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF SELF-INSURANCE AND THE PURCHASE OF COMMERCIAL INSURANCE DESIGNED TO PROTECT AGAINST EVENTS THAT COULD GENERATE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES. DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE EXECUTION OF OUR MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES RESIDES WITH OUR TREASURER'S OFFICE AND IS GOVERNED BY WRITTEN POLICES AND PROCEDURES. SEPARATION OF DUTIES IS MAINTAINED BETWEEN THE DEVELOPMENT AND AUTHORIZATION OF DERIVATIVE TRADES, THE TRANSACTION OF DERIVATIVES, AND THE SETTLEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. REGULAR AUDITS ARE CONDUCTED TO ENSURE THAT APPROPRIATE CONTROLS ARE IN PLACE AND THAT THEY REMAIN EFFECTIVE. IN ADDITION, OUR MARKET RISK EXPOSURES AND OUR USE OF DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES ARE REVIEWED BY THE GRMC AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR DERIVATIVES, SEE NOTE 17 OF OUR NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISKS OF OUR AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR AND FORD CREDIT ARE DISCUSSED AND QUANTIFIED BELOW. THE QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES PRESENTED ARE INDEPENDENT OF ANY ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO SFAS NO. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES. AUTOMOTIVE MARKET AND COUNTERPARTY RISK OUR AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR FREQUENTLY HAS EXPENDITURES AND RECEIPTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: PURCHASES AND SALES OF FINISHED VEHICLES AND PRODUCTION PARTS, DEBT AND OTHER PAYABLES, SUBSIDIARY DIVIDENDS, AND INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS. THESE EXPENDITURES AND RECEIPTS CREATE EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES. WE ALSO ARE EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN PRICES OF COMMODITIES USED IN OUR AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR AND CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. 65 <PAGE> ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (CONTINUED) FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK AND COMMODITY RISK ARE MEASURED AND QUANTIFIED USING A MODEL TO CALCULATE THE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF CURRENCY AND COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE BEING HEDGED. BEGINNING WITH THIS REPORT, WE HAVE CHANGED OUR RISK DISCLOSURE METHODOLOGY TO AN EARNINGS AT RISK ("EAR") MODEL FROM A VALUE AT RISK ("VAR"). VAR IS A VALUATION OF THE EXISTING HEDGE PORTFOLIO AND PROJECTS THE POTENTIAL CHANGE IN THE PORTFOLIO'S LIQUIDATION VALUE. EAR PROVIDES THE POTENTIAL IMPACT TO PRE-TAX EARNINGS RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY AND COMMODITY PRICE EXPOSURE AND IS A MORE MEANINGFUL METRIC TO AN ONGOING BUSINESS THAN VAR. THE MODEL TO CALCULATE EAR COMBINES CURRENT MARKET DATA WITH HISTORICAL DATA ON VOLATILITIES AND CORRELATIONS OF THE UNDERLYING CURRENCIES AND COMMODITY PRICES. EAR INCLUDES HEDGING DERIVATIVES AS WELL AS THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES OVER A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK --------------------- FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE BETTER OR WORSE THAN PLANNED BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE ASSETS, LIABILITIES, INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS, AND FIRM COMMITMENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. IN OUR HEDGING ACTIONS, WE USE PRIMARILY INSTRUMENTS COMMONLY USED BY CORPORATIONS TO REDUCE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK (E.G., FORWARD CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS). OUR EAR IS BASED ON TRANSACTION EXPOSURE, WHICH IS THE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE THAT RESULTS FROM CROSS BORDER CASH FLOWS FROM SPECIFIC TRANSACTIONS, AND OUR RELATED HEDGING ACTIVITY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE EAR FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE MOVEMENTS OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS IS LESS THAN $390 MILLION, WITHIN A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY $60 MILLION HIGHER THAN THE EAR PROJECTION FOR 2002 CALCULATED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001. THE INCREASED EXPOSURE RESULTS PRIMARILY FROM LESS DIVERSIFICATION BENEFIT DUE TO HIGHER CORRELATION AMONG MAJOR CURRENCY PAIRINGS. COMMODITY PRICE RISK -------------------- COMMODITY PRICE RISK IS THE POSSIBILITY OF HIGHER OR LOWER COSTS DUE TO CHANGES IN THE PRICES OF COMMODITIES, SUCH AS NON-FERROUS (E.G., ALUMINUM) AND PRECIOUS METALS (E.G., PALLADIUM, PLATINUM AND RHODIUM), FERROUS ALLOYS (E.G., STEEL), ENERGY (E.G., NATURAL GAS AND ELECTRICITY), AND PLASTICS/RESINS (E.G., POLYPROPYLENE), WHICH WE USE IN THE PRODUCTION OF MOTOR VEHICLES. WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE THE PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE OF THOSE COMMODITIES THAT WE CAN ECONOMICALLY HEDGE. IN OUR HEDGING ACTIONS, WE PRIMARILY USE INSTRUMENTS COMMONLY USED BY CORPORATIONS TO REDUCE COMMODITY PRICE RISK (E.G., FINANCIALLY SETTLED FORWARD CONTRACTS, SWAPS, AND OPTIONS). BASED ON OUR FINANCIAL HEDGING ACTIVITIES WITH DERIVATIVES AND THE ASSOCIATED UNDERLYING EXPOSURES (E.G., PRECIOUS METALS, ALUMINUM, COPPER, NATURAL GAS, AND UNLEADED GAS), AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE EAR FROM COMMODITY PRICE MOVEMENTS OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS IS LESS THAN $59 MILLION, WITHIN A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION LOWER THAN THE EAR PROJECTION FOR 2002 CALCULATED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001. THE DECREASED EXPOSURE RESULTS PRIMARILY FROM DECLINING CONSUMPTION EXPOSURES AND A LOWER COST BASIS. IN ADDITION TO THESE PRICE-HEDGING ACTIVITIES, OUR PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF RAW MATERIALS USED IN OUR BUSINESS. THESE PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES UTILIZE FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACTS, LONG-TERM SUPPLY CONTRACTS, AND STOCKPILES. ANY PRICE-HEDGING INHERENT IN OUR PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES IS APPROVED BY THE GRMC. INTEREST RATE RISK ------------------ INTEREST RATE RISK RELATES TO THE GAIN OR LOSS WE COULD INCUR TO OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES. WE HAVE $25.3 BILLION IN CASH (INCLUDING ASSETS CONTAINED IN A VEBA TRUST), WHICH WE INVEST IN SECURITIES OF VARIOUS TYPES AND MATURITIES. MANY OF THESE SECURITIES ARE INTEREST SENSITIVE. THESE SECURITIES ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED AS TRADING OR AVAILABLE FOR SALE. THE TRADING PORTFOLIO GAINS AND LOSSES (UNREALIZED AND REALIZED) ARE REPORTED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT. THE AVAILABLE FOR SALE PORTFOLIO REALIZED 66 <PAGE> ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (CONTINUED) GAINS OR LOSSES ARE REPORTED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT, AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS BASED ON CLEARLY DEFINED RISK AND LIQUIDITY GUIDELINES TO MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY, MINIMIZE RISK, AND EARN A REASONABLE RETURN ON THE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT. AT ANY TIME, A RISE IN INTEREST RATES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR TRADING AND OUR AVAILABLE FOR SALE PORTFOLIOS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE VALUE OF OUR TRADING PORTFOLIO WAS $18.5 BILLION (INCLUDING ASSETS CONTAINED IN A VEBA TRUST), THE VALUE OF OUR AVAILABLE FOR SALE PORTFOLIO WAS $1.6 BILLION, AND THE VALUE OF OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WAS $5.2 BILLION. ASSUMING A HYPOTHETICAL, INSTANTANEOUS INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES OF ONE PERCENTAGE POINT, THE VALUE OF OUR AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND TRADING PORTFOLIOS WOULD BE REDUCED BY $185 MILLION AND $27 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. WHILE THIS IS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE IMPACT OF THE SPECIFIED INTEREST RATE SCENARIO, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE PROJECTED. THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS PRESENTED ASSUMES INTEREST RATE CHANGES ARE INSTANTANEOUS, PARALLEL SHIFTS IN THE YIELD CURVE. IN REALITY, INTEREST RATE CHANGES ARE RARELY INSTANTANEOUS OR PARALLEL. COUNTERPARTY RISK ----------------- COUNTERPARTY RISK RELATES TO THE LOSS WE COULD INCUR IF AN OBLIGOR OR COUNTERPARTY DEFAULTED ON AN INVESTMENT OR A DERIVATIVE CONTRACT. EXPOSURES PRIMARILY RELATE TO INVESTMENTS IN FIXED-INCOME INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS USED FOR MANAGING INTEREST RATE, CURRENCY AND COMMODITY RISK. WE, TOGETHER WITH FORD CREDIT, ESTABLISH EXPOSURE LIMITS FOR EACH COUNTERPARTY TO MINIMIZE RISK AND PROVIDE COUNTERPARTY DIVERSIFICATION. OUR EXPOSURES ARE MONITORED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND ARE INCLUDED IN MONTHLY REPORTING TO THE GRMC. OUR APPROACH TO MANAGING COUNTERPARTY RISK IS FORWARD-LOOKING AND PROACTIVE, ALLOWING US TO TAKE RISK MITIGATION ACTIONS. WE ESTABLISH EXPOSURE LIMITS FOR BOTH MARK-TO-MARKET AND FUTURE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE, BASED ON OUR OVERALL RISK TOLERANCE AND RATINGS-BASED HISTORICAL DEFAULT PROBABILITIES. THE EXPOSURE LIMITS ARE LOWER FOR LOWER-RATED COUNTERPARTIES AND FOR LONGER-DATED EXPOSURES. WE USE A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION TECHNIQUE TO ASSESS OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE BY TENOR, DEFINED AT A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR COUNTERPARTY AND OBLIGOR EXPOSURES ARE WITH COUNTERPARTIES AND OBLIGORS THAT ARE RATED SINGLE-A OR BETTER. FORD CREDIT MARKET RISKS OVERVIEW -------- FORD CREDIT IS EXPOSED TO RISKS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION TO COUNTERPARTY RISK DISCUSSED ABOVE, FORD CREDIT IS SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL TYPES OF RISKS THAT IT SEEKS TO IDENTIFY, ASSESS, MONITOR AND MANAGE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH DEFINED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES: O MARKET RISK - THE POSSIBILITY THAT CHANGES IN FUTURE MARKET INTEREST AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OR PRICES WILL HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OPERATING RESULTS. O CREDIT RISK - THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSS FROM A CUSTOMER'S FAILURE TO MAKE PAYMENTS ACCORDING TO CONTRACT TERMS. O RESIDUAL RISK - THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ACTUAL PROCEEDS RECEIVED BY FORD CREDIT UPON THE SALE OF RETURNED LEASE VEHICLES AT LEASE TERMINATION WILL BE LOWER THAN ITS INTERNAL FORECAST OF RESIDUAL VALUES. O LIQUIDITY RISK - THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING UNABLE TO MEET ALL CURRENT AND FUTURE OBLIGATIONS IN A TIMELY MANNER. EACH FORM OF RISK IS UNIQUELY MANAGED IN THE CONTEXT OF ITS CONTRIBUTION TO FORD CREDIT'S OVERALL GLOBAL RISK. BUSINESS DECISIONS ARE EVALUATED ON A RISK-ADJUSTED BASIS AND PRODUCTS ARE PRICED CONSISTENT 67 <PAGE> ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (CONTINUED) WITH THESE RISKS. CREDIT AND RESIDUAL RISKS ARE DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER THE CAPTION "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES" AND LIQUIDITY RISK IS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER THE CAPTION "LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES--FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR-- FORD CREDIT", IN EACH CASE IN ITEM 7. "MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS." THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSES FORD CREDIT'S MARKET RISKS: FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. TO MEET FUNDING OBJECTIVES, FORD CREDIT ISSUES DEBT OR, FOR ITS INTERNATIONAL AFFILIATES, DRAWS ON LOCAL CREDIT LINES IN A VARIETY OF CURRENCIES. FORD CREDIT FACES EXPOSURE TO CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IF A MISMATCH EXISTS BETWEEN THE CURRENCY OF ITS RECEIVABLES AND THE CURRENCY OF THE DEBT FUNDING THOSE RECEIVABLES. WHEN POSSIBLE, RECEIVABLES ARE FUNDED WITH DEBT IN THE SAME CURRENCY, MINIMIZING EXPOSURE TO EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS. WHEN A DIFFERENT CURRENCY IS USED, FORD CREDIT SEEKS TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON OPERATING RESULTS BY EXECUTING FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVES. THESE DERIVATIVES CONVERT SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY DEBT OBLIGATIONS TO THE LOCAL COUNTRY CURRENCY OF THE RECEIVABLES. AS A RESULT, FORD CREDIT'S MARKET RISK EXPOSURE RELATING TO CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IS BELIEVED TO BE IMMATERIAL. INTEREST RATE RISK. INTEREST RATE RISK IS THE PRIMARY MARKET RISK TO WHICH FORD CREDIT IS EXPOSED AND CONSISTS PRINCIPALLY OF "RE-PRICING RISK" OR DIFFERENCES IN THE RE-PRICING CHARACTERISTICS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. AN INSTRUMENT'S RE-PRICING PERIOD IS A TERM USED BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO DESCRIBE HOW AN INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE INSTRUMENT RESPONDS TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. IT REFERS TO THE TIME IT TAKES AN INSTRUMENT'S INTEREST RATE TO REFLECT A CHANGE IN MARKET INTEREST RATES. FOR FIXED-RATE INSTRUMENTS, THE RE-PRICING PERIOD IS EQUAL TO THE MATURITY FOR REPAYMENT OF THE INSTRUMENT'S PRINCIPAL BECAUSE, WITH A FIXED INTEREST RATE, THE PRINCIPAL IS CONSIDERED TO RE-PRICE ONLY WHEN RE-INVESTED IN A NEW INSTRUMENT. FOR A FLOATING-RATE INSTRUMENT, THE RE-PRICING PERIOD IS THE PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE THE INTEREST RATE ADJUSTS TO THE MARKET RATE. FOR INSTANCE, A FLOATING-RATE LOAN WHOSE INTEREST RATE IS RESET TO A MARKET INDEX ANNUALLY ON DECEMBER 31ST WOULD HAVE A RE-PRICING PERIOD OF ONE YEAR ON JANUARY 1ST, REGARDLESS OF THE INSTRUMENT'S MATURITY. FORD CREDIT'S RECEIVABLES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FIXED-RATE RETAIL INSTALLMENT SALE AND LEASE CONTRACTS AND FLOATING-RATE WHOLESALE RECEIVABLES. FIXED-RATE RETAIL INSTALLMENT SALE AND LEASE CONTRACTS ARE ORIGINATED PRINCIPALLY WITH MATURITIES RANGING BETWEEN TWO AND SIX YEARS AND GENERALLY REQUIRE CUSTOMERS TO MAKE EQUAL MONTHLY PAYMENTS OVER THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACT. FORD CREDIT'S FUNDING SOURCES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF SHORT AND LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT AND SALES OF RECEIVABLES IN SECURITIZATIONS. IN THE CASE OF UNSECURED TERM DEBT, AND IN AN EFFORT TO HAVE FUNDS AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT BUSINESS CYCLES, FORD CREDIT OFTEN BORROWS LONGER-TERM, WITH FIVE TO TEN YEAR MATURITIES. THESE DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE PRINCIPALLY FIXED-RATE AND REQUIRE FIXED AND EQUAL INTEREST PAYMENTS OVER THE LIFE OF THE INSTRUMENT AND A SINGLE PRINCIPAL PAYMENT AT MATURITY. FORD CREDIT IS EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK TO THE EXTENT THAT A DIFFERENCE EXISTS BETWEEN THE RE-PRICING PROFILE OF ITS ASSETS AND DEBT. SPECIFICALLY, WITHOUT DERIVATIVES, FORD CREDIT'S ASSETS WOULD RE-PRICE MORE QUICKLY THAN ITS DEBT. FORD CREDIT'S INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE IS TO MAXIMIZE ITS FINANCING MARGIN WHILE LIMITING FLUCTUATIONS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. FORD CREDIT ACHIEVES THIS OBJECTIVE BY SETTING AN ESTABLISHED RISK TOLERANCE RANGE AND STAYING WITHIN THIS TOLERANCE RANGE THROUGH AN INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES ENTERING INTO DERIVATIVES COMMONLY KNOWN AS INTEREST RATE SWAPS. ON A MONTHLY BASIS, FORD CREDIT DETERMINES THE SENSITIVITY OF THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF ITS PORTFOLIO OF INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (ITS ECONOMIC VALUE) TO HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. ECONOMIC VALUE IS A MEASURE OF THE PRESENT VALUE OF ALL FUTURE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS, DISCOUNTED BY MARKET INTEREST RATES, AND IS EQUAL TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE ASSETS MINUS THE PRESENT VALUE OF INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE LIABILITIES. FORD CREDIT THEN ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS, EFFECTIVELY CONVERTING PORTIONS OF ITS FLOATING-RATE DEBT OR ASSETS TO FIXED OR ITS FIXED-RATE DEBT OR ASSETS TO FLOATING, TO ENSURE THAT THE SENSITIVITY OF ITS ECONOMIC VALUE FALLS WITHIN AN ESTABLISHED TARGET RANGE. FORD CREDIT ALSO MONITORS THE SENSITIVITY OF ITS EARNINGS TO INTEREST RATES USING EARNINGS SIMULATION TECHNIQUES. THESE SIMULATIONS CALCULATE THE PROJECTED EARNINGS OF ITS PORTFOLIO OF INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES UNDER VARIOUS INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS, INCLUDING BOTH PARALLEL AND NON-PARALLEL SHIFTS IN THE YIELD CURVE. THESE QUANTIFICATIONS OF INTEREST RATE RISK ARE INCLUDED IN MONTHLY REPORTING TO THE GRMC. 68 <PAGE> ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (CONTINUED) THE PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE IS USED TO MEASURE AND MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK OF FORD CREDIT'S OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA, WHICH TOGETHER REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 74% OF ITS TOTAL OWNED FINANCE RECEIVABLES AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. FOR ITS INTERNATIONAL AFFILIATES, FORD CREDIT USES A TECHNIQUE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS "GAP ANALYSIS," TO MEASURE RE-PRICING MISMATCH. THIS PROCESS USES RE-PRICING SCHEDULES, WHICH GROUP ASSETS, DEBT, AND SWAPS INTO TIME-BANDS BASED ON THEIR RE-PRICING PERIOD. UNDER THIS PROCESS, FORD CREDIT ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS, EFFECTIVELY CHANGING THE RE-PRICING PROFILE OF ITS ASSETS AND DEBT, TO ENSURE THAT ANY RE-PRICING MISMATCH EXISTING IN A PARTICULAR TIME-BAND FALLS WITHIN AN ESTABLISHED TOLERANCE. AS A RESULT OF ITS INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVES, FORD CREDIT'S DEBT RE-PRICES SLIGHTLY FASTER THAN ITS ASSETS. OTHER THINGS EQUAL, THIS MEANS THAT DURING A PERIOD OF RISING INTEREST RATES, THE INTEREST RATES PAID ON FORD CREDIT'S DEBT WILL INCREASE MORE RAPIDLY THAN THE INTEREST RATES EARNED ON ASSETS, THEREBY INITIALLY REDUCING FORD CREDIT'S EARNINGS BY A SMALL AMOUNT. CORRESPONDINGLY, DURING A PERIOD OF FALLING INTEREST RATES, FORD CREDIT'S EARNINGS WOULD BE EXPECTED TO INITIALLY INCREASE BY A SMALL AMOUNT. TO PROVIDE A QUANTITATIVE MEASURE OF THE SENSITIVITY OF ITS EARNINGS TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, FORD CREDIT USES INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS THAT ASSUME A HYPOTHETICAL, INSTANTANEOUS INCREASE OR DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES OF ONE PERCENTAGE POINT ACROSS ALL MATURITIES, AS WELL AS A BASE CASE THAT ASSUMES THAT INTEREST RATES REMAIN CONSTANT AT EXISTING LEVELS. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE SCENARIOS AND THE BASE CASE OVER A ONE YEAR HORIZON REPRESENT AN ESTIMATE OF THE SENSITIVITY OF FORD CREDIT'S PRE-TAX EARNINGS OVER THE FOLLOWING YEAR. THIS SENSITIVITY AS OF YEAR-END 2001 AND 2002 IS AS FOLLOWS: <TABLE> <CAPTION> PRE-TAX EARNINGS IMPACT GIVEN A PRE-TAX EARNINGS IMPACT GIVEN A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES (IN MILLIONS) INTEREST RATES (IN MILLIONS) <S> <C> <C> DECEMBER 31, 2002 $(153) $156 DECEMBER 31, 2001 $(120) $121 </TABLE> WHILE THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS PRESENTED IS FORD CREDIT'S BEST ESTIMATE OF THE IMPACTS OF SPECIFIED ASSUMED INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE PROJECTED. THE MODEL USED TO CONDUCT THIS ANALYSIS IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON ASSUMPTIONS, PARTICULARLY THOSE REGARDING THE REINVESTMENT OF MATURING ASSET PRINCIPAL, REFINANCING OF MATURING DEBT, AND PREDICTED REPAYMENT OF SALE AND LEASE CONTRACTS AHEAD OF CONTRACTUAL MATURITY. 69 <PAGE>
