FORD CREDIT FACES EXPOSURE TO CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IF A MISMATCH EXISTS BETWEEN THE CURRENCY OF ITS RECEIVABLES AND THE CURRENCY OF THE DEBT FUNDING THOSE RECEIVABLES. WHEN POSSIBLE, RECEIVABLES ARE FUNDED WITH DEBT IN THE SAME CURRENCY, MINIMIZING EXPOSURE TO EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS. WHEN A DIFFERENT CURRENCY IS USED, FORD CREDIT SEEKS TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON OPERATING RESULTS BY EXECUTING FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVES. THESE DERIVATIVES CONVERT SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY DEBT OBLIGATIONS TO THE LOCAL COUNTRY CURRENCY OF THE RECEIVABLES. AS A RESULT, FORD CREDIT&#146;S MARKET RISK EXPOSURE RELATING TO CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IS BELIEVED TO BE IMMATERIAL. </FONT> <P ALIGN="LEFT">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP; <I><FONT SIZE="2">INTEREST RATE RISK.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE="2"> INTEREST RATE RISK IS THE PRIMARY MARKET RISK TO WHICH FORD CREDIT IS EXPOSED AND CONSISTS PRINCIPALLY OF &#147;RE-PRICING RISK&#148; OR DIFFERENCES IN THE RE-PRICING CHARACTERISTICS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. AN INSTRUMENT&#146;S RE-PRICING PERIOD IS A TERM USED BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO DESCRIBE HOW AN INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE INSTRUMENT RESPONDS TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. IT REFERS TO THE TIME IT TAKES AN INSTRUMENT&#146;S INTEREST RATE TO REFLECT A CHANGE IN MARKET INTEREST RATES. FOR FIXED-RATE INSTRUMENTS, THE RE-PRICING PERIOD IS EQUAL TO THE MATURITY FOR REPAYMENT OF THE INSTRUMENT&#146;S PRINCIPAL BECAUSE, WITH A FIXED INTEREST RATE, THE PRINCIPAL IS CONSIDERED TO RE-PRICE ONLY WHEN RE-INVESTED IN A NEW INSTRUMENT. FOR A FLOATING-RATE INSTRUMENT, THE RE-PRICING PERIOD IS THE PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE THE INTEREST RATE ADJUSTS TO THE MARKET RATE. FOR INSTANCE, A FLOATING-RATE LOAN WHOSE INTEREST RATE IS RESET TO A MARKET INDEX ANNUALLY ON DECEMBER&NBSP;31ST WOULD HAVE A RE-PRICING PERIOD OF ONE YEAR ON JANUARY&NBSP;1ST, REGARDLESS OF THE INSTRUMENT&#146;S MATURITY. </FONT> <P ALIGN="LEFT">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP; <FONT SIZE="2">FORD CREDIT&#146;S RECEIVABLES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FIXED-RATE RETAIL INSTALLMENT SALE AND LEASE CONTRACTS AND FLOATING-RATE WHOLESALE RECEIVABLES. FIXED-RATE RETAIL INSTALLMENT SALE AND LEASE CONTRACTS ARE ORIGINATED PRINCIPALLY WITH MATURITIES RANGING BETWEEN TWO AND SIX YEARS AND GENERALLY REQUIRE CUSTOMERS TO MAKE EQUAL MONTHLY PAYMENTS OVER THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACT. FORD CREDIT&#146;S FUNDING SOURCES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF SHORT- AND LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT AND SALES OF RECEIVABLES IN SECURITIZATIONS. IN THE CASE OF UNSECURED TERM DEBT, AND IN AN EFFORT TO HAVE FUNDS AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE BUSINESS CYCLES, FORD CREDIT MAY BORROW AT TERMS LONGER THAN THE TERM OF ITS ASSETS, WITH FIVE TO TEN YEAR MATURITIES. THESE DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE PRINCIPALLY FIXED-RATE AND REQUIRE FIXED AND EQUAL INTEREST PAYMENTS OVER THE LIFE OF THE INSTRUMENT AND A SINGLE PRINCIPAL PAYMENT AT MATURITY. </FONT> <P ALIGN="LEFT">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP; <FONT SIZE="2">FORD CREDIT IS EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK TO THE EXTENT THAT A DIFFERENCE EXISTS BETWEEN THE RE-PRICING PROFILE OF ITS ASSETS AND DEBT.

FORD CREDIT ACHIEVES THIS OBJECTIVE BY SETTING AN ESTABLISHED RISK TOLERANCE RANGE AND STAYING WITHIN THIS TOLERANCE RANGE THROUGH AN INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES ENTERING INTO DERIVATIVES COMMONLY KNOWN AS INTEREST RATE SWAPS. </FONT> <P ALIGN="LEFT">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP; <FONT SIZE="2">ON A MONTHLY BASIS, FORD CREDIT DETERMINES THE SENSITIVITY OF THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF ITS PORTFOLIO OF INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (ITS ECONOMIC VALUE) TO HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. ECONOMIC VALUE IS A MEASURE OF THE PRESENT VALUE OF ALL FUTURE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS, DISCOUNTED BY MARKET INTEREST RATES, AND IS EQUAL TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE ASSETS MINUS THE PRESENT VALUE OF INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE LIABILITIES. FORD CREDIT THEN ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS, EFFECTIVELY CONVERTING PORTIONS OF ITS FLOATING-RATE DEBT OR ASSETS TO FIXED OR ITS FIXED-RATE DEBT OR ASSETS TO FLOATING, TO ENSURE THAT THE SENSITIVITY OF ITS ECONOMIC VALUE FALLS WITHIN AN ESTABLISHED TARGET RANGE. FORD CREDIT ALSO MONITORS THE SENSITIVITY OF ITS EARNINGS TO INTEREST RATES USING PRE-TAX NET INTEREST INCOME SIMULATION TECHNIQUES. THESE SIMULATIONS CALCULATE THE PROJECTED PRE-TAX NET INTEREST INCOME OF ITS PORTFOLIO OF INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES UNDER VARIOUS INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS, INCLUDING BOTH PARALLEL AND NON-PARALLEL SHIFTS IN THE YIELD CURVE. THESE QUANTIFICATIONS OF INTEREST RATE RISK ARE INCLUDED IN MONTHLY REPORTING TO THE TREASURER. </FONT> <P ALIGN="LEFT">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP; <FONT SIZE="2">THE PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE IS USED TO MEASURE AND MANAGE THE INTEREST RATE RISK OF FORD CREDIT&#146;S OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, WHICH TOGETHER REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 85% OF ITS TOTAL ON-BALANCE SHEET FINANCE RECEIVABLES AT DECEMBER&NBSP;31, 2003. FOR ITS INTERNATIONAL AFFILIATES, FORD CREDIT USES A TECHNIQUE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS &#147;GAP ANALYSIS,&#148; TO MEASURE RE-PRICING MISMATCH. THIS PROCESS USES RE-PRICING SCHEDULES, WHICH GROUP ASSETS, DEBT, AND SWAPS INTO TIME-BANDS BASED ON THEIR RE-PRICING PERIOD. UNDER THIS PROCESS, FORD CREDIT ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS, EFFECTIVELY CHANGING THE RE-PRICING PROFILE OF ITS ASSETS AND DEBT, TO ENSURE THAT ANY RE-PRICING MISMATCH EXISTING IN A PARTICULAR TIME-BAND FALLS WITHIN AN ESTABLISHED TOLERANCE. </FONT> <P ALIGN="LEFT">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP; <FONT SIZE="2">AS A RESULT OF ITS INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVES, FORD CREDIT&#146;S DEBT RE-PRICES FASTER THAN ITS ASSETS. OTHER THINGS EQUAL, THIS MEANS THAT DURING A PERIOD OF RISING INTEREST RATES, THE INTEREST RATES PAID ON FORD CREDIT&#146;S DEBT WILL INCREASE MORE RAPIDLY THAN THE INTEREST RATES EARNED ON ASSETS, THEREBY INITIALLY REDUCING FORD CREDIT&#146;S PRE-TAX NET INTEREST INCOME. CORRESPONDINGLY, DURING A PERIOD OF FALLING INTEREST RATES, FORD CREDIT&#146;S PRE-TAX NET INTEREST INCOME WOULD BE EXPECTED TO INITIALLY INCREASE. TO PROVIDE A QUANTITATIVE MEASURE OF THE SENSITIVITY OF ITS PRE-TAX NET INTEREST INCOME TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, FORD CREDIT USES INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS THAT ASSUME A HYPOTHETICAL, INSTANTANEOUS INCREASE OR DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES OF ONE PERCENTAGE POINT ACROSS ALL MATURITIES, AS WELL AS A BASE CASE THAT ASSUMES THAT INTEREST RATES REMAIN CONSTANT AT EXISTING LEVELS. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE SCENARIOS AND THE BASE CASE OVER A TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD REPRESENT AN ESTIMATE OF THE SENSITIVITY OF FORD CREDIT&#146;S PRE-TAX NET INTEREST INCOME.

HAD THE ANALYSIS ASSUMED A GRADUAL CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES OF 100 BASIS POINTS, IT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A LOWER PRE-TAX NET INTEREST INCOME IMPACT. THE MODEL USED TO CONDUCT THIS ANALYSIS IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON ASSUMPTIONS, PARTICULARLY THOSE REGARDING THE REINVESTMENT OF MATURING ASSET PRINCIPAL, REFINANCING OF MATURING DEBT, AND PREDICTED REPAYMENT OF SALE AND LEASE CONTRACTS AHEAD OF CONTRACTUAL MATURITY. </FONT> <P ALIGN="LEFT">&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP;&NBSP; <FONT SIZE="2">THE FAIR VALUE OF NET DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (DERIVATIVE ASSETS LESS DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES) AS OF DECEMBER&NBSP;31, 2003 AS REPORTED IN NOTE&NBSP;16 OF THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WAS $8.9&NBSP;BILLION, APPROXIMATELY $1.3&NBSP;BILLION HIGHER THAN A YEAR AGO. THIS INCREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE STRENGTHENING OF THE EURO AGAINST THE U.S.&NBSP;DOLLAR WHICH INCREASES THE VALUE OF RECEIVE-EURO/ PAY-U.S.&NBSP;DOLLAR CROSS CURRENCY SWAPS AND THE DECREASE IN U.S.&NBSP;INTEREST RATES WHICH INCREASES THE VALUE OF OUR PAY-FLOATING/ RECEIVE-FIXED RATE SWAPS.
