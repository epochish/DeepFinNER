Portions of the Proxy Statement are incorporated by reference herein into Part III.   PART I  Item 1.  BUSINESS Hershey Foods Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Corporation) are engaged in the manufacture, distribution and sale of confectionery and grocery products. The Corporation was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 24, 1927, as a successor to a business founded in 1894 by Milton S. Hershey.  In June 2002, the Corporation completed the sale of a group of the Corporations non-chocolate confectionery candy brands to Farleys & Sathers Candy Company, Inc. for $12.0 million in cash as part of its business realignment initiatives. Included in the transaction were the HEIDE, JUJYFRUITS, WUNDERBEANS and AMAZIN FRUIT trademarked confectionery brands as well as the rights to sell CHUCKLES branded products, under license.  The Corporations principal product groups include: confectionery products sold in the form of bar goods, bagged items and boxed items; and grocery products in the form of baking ingredients, chocolate drink mixes, peanut butter, dessert toppings and beverages. The Corporation believes it is a leader in many of these product groups in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Operating profit margins vary considerably among individual products and brands. Generally, such margins on confectionery products are greater than those on grocery products.  The Corporation manufactures confectionery products in a variety of packaged forms and markets them under more than 50 brands. The different packaged forms include various arrangements of the same bar products, such as boxes, trays and bags, as well as a variety of different sizes and weights of the same bar products, such as snack size, standard, king size, large and giant bars. Among the principal confectionery products in the United States are: HERSHEYS COOKIES N CREME candy bars, HERSHEYS HUGS chocolates, HERSHEYS KISSES chocolates, HERSHEYS KISSES chocolates with almonds, HERSHEYS chocolate bars, HERSHEYS chocolate bars with almonds, HERSHEYS MINIATURES chocolate bars, HERSHEYS NUGGETS chocolates, COOL BLAST mints, FAST BREAK candy bars, ICE BREAKERS mints and chewing gum, JOLLY RANCHER candy, KIT KAT and KIT KAT BIG KAT wafer bars, KRACKEL chocolate bars, MR. GOODBAR chocolate bars, REESES NUTRAGEOUS candy bars, REESES peanut butter cups, REESES PIECES candies, REESESTICKS wafer bars, SPECIAL DARK chocolate bars and SYMPHONY chocolate bars. Other confectionery products include: HERSHEYS BITES candies, HERSHEYS classic caramels, ALMOND JOY candy bars, BREATH SAVERS mints, BUBBLE YUM bubble gum, CARAMELLO candy bars, CAREFREE, CAREFREE KOOLERZ and FRUIT STRIPE chewing gums, GOOD & PLENTY candy, HEATH toffee bars, MILK DUDS candy, MOUNDS candy bars, PAYDAY candy bars, POT OF GOLD boxed chocolates, RAIN-BLO gumballs, ROLO caramels in milk chocolate, SKOR toffee bars, SUPER BUBBLE bubble gum, TASTETATIONS candy, TWIZZLERS candy, WHATCHAMACALLIT candy bars, WHOPPERS malted milk balls, YORK peppermint pattie candy, 5TH AVENUE candy bars and ZERO candy bars.  The Corporation also manufactures and/or markets grocery products in the baking, beverage, peanut butter and toppings categories. Principal products in the United States include HERSHEYS, REESES and HEATH baking pieces, HERSHEYS chocolate milk mix, HERSHEYS cocoa, HERSHEYS CHOCOLATE SHOPPE ice cream toppings, HERSHEYS HOT COCOA COLLECTION hot cocoa mix, HERSHEYS syrup and REESES peanut butter. HERSHEYS chocolate and strawberry flavored milks are produced and sold under license by various dairies throughout the United States, using milk mixes manufactured by the Corporation. Baking and various other products are produced and sold under the HERSHEYS and REESES brand names by third parties that have been granted licenses by the Corporation to use these trademarks.  Principal products in Canada include CHIPITS chocolate chips, GLOSETTE chocolate-covered raisins, peanuts and almonds, OH HENRY! candy bars, POT OF GOLD boxed chocolates, REESE PEANUT BUTTER CUPS candy and TWIZZLERS candy. The Corporation also manufactures, imports, markets, sells and distributes chocolate products in Mexico under the HERSHEYS brand name.  The Corporation has license agreements with several companies to manufacture and/or sell products worldwide. Among the more significant are agreements with affiliated companies of Cadbury Schweppes p.l.c. to manufacture and/or market and distribute YORK, PETER PAUL ALMOND JOY and PETER PAUL MOUNDS confectionery products worldwide as well as CADBURY and CARAMELLO confectionery products in the United States. The Corporations rights under these agreements are extendible on a long-term basis at the Corporations option. The license for CADBURY and CARAMELLO products is subject to a minimum sales requirement that the Corporation exceeded in 2002. The Corporation also has an agreement with Societe des Produits Nestle SA, which licenses the 1   Corporation  to  manufacture   and   distribute   KIT  KAT  and   ROLO confectionery  products in the United States. The Corporations  rights under   this   agreement   are   extendible   on  a   long-term   basis  at  the Corporations option, subject to certain conditions, including minimum unit volume sales.  In 2002,  the minimum  volume  requirements  were  exceeded.  The Corporation   has  an  agreement   with  an  affiliate  of   Huhtamäki   Oy (Huhtamaki)  pursuant  to  which  it  licenses  the  use of  certain trademarks,  including GOOD & PLENTY,  HEATH,  JOLLY RANCHER,  MILK DUDS, PAYDAY  and  WHOPPERS  for  confectionery  products  worldwide.   The Corporations  rights under this  agreement  are  extendible on a long-term basis at the Corporations option.  The Corporations products are sold primarily to grocery wholesalers, chain grocery stores, candy distributors, mass merchandisers, chain drug stores, vending companies, wholesale clubs, convenience stores, concessionaires and food distributors by full-time sales representatives, food brokers and part-time retail sales merchandisers throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. The Corporation believes its products are sold in over 2 million retail outlets in North America. In 2002, sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries amounted to approximately 21 percent of the Corporations total net sales.  The Corporation manufactures, imports, markets, sells and distributes chocolate products in Brazil under the HERSHEYS brand name. Additional products in Brazil include IO-IO hazelnut crème items and chocolate and confectionery products sold under the VISCONTI brand name. In China, Japan, Korea and the Philippines, the Corporation imports and/or markets selected confectionery and grocery products. The Corporation also markets confectionery and grocery products in over 90 countries worldwide.  The Corporations marketing strategy is based upon the consistently superior quality of its products, mass distribution and the best possible consumer value in terms of price and weight. In addition, the Corporation devotes considerable resources to the identification, development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of new products. The Corporation utilizes a variety of promotional programs for customers and advertising and promotional programs for consumers. The Corporation employs promotional programs at various times during the year to stimulate sales of certain products. Confectionery and grocery seasonal and holiday-related sales have typically been highest during the third and fourth quarters of the year.  The Corporation recognizes that the mass distribution of its confectionery and grocery  products is an important element in maintaining sales growth and providing service to its customers. The Corporation attempts to meet the changing demands of its customers by planning optimum stock levels and reasonable delivery times consistent with achievement of efficiencies in distribution. To achieve these objectives, the Corporation has developed a distribution network from its manufacturing plants, distribution centers and field warehouses strategically located throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. The Corporation uses a combination of public and contract carriers to deliver its products from the distribution points to its customers. In conjunction with sales and marketing efforts, the distribution system has been instrumental in the effective promotion of new, as well as established, products on both national and regional scales.  From time to time, the Corporation has changed the prices and weights of its products to accommodate changes in manufacturing costs, the competitive environment and profit objectives, while at the same time maintaining consumer value. The Corporation implemented an increase in the wholesale price of its domestic standard size, king size, variety pack, 6-pack and 10-pack lines effective January 1, 2003. The standard size increase was approximately 11 percent. The effect of all the increases translates into an approximate 3 percent increase over the entire domestic product line. The last standard candy bar price increase was implemented by the Corporation in December 1995.  The most significant raw material used in the production of the Corporations chocolate products is cocoa beans. This commodity is imported principally from Far Eastern, West African and South American equatorial regions. West Africa accounts for approximately 70 percent of the worlds crop. Cocoa beans are not uniform, and the various grades and varieties reflect the diverse agricultural practices and natural conditions found in the many growing areas. The Corporation buys a mix of cocoa beans and cocoa products to meet its manufacturing requirements.  The table below sets forth  annual  average  cocoa prices as well as the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated. The prices are the monthly  average of the  quotations at noon of the three active  futures trading contracts closest to maturity on the New York Board of Trade. Because of the Corporations forward purchasing practices discussed below, and premium prices paid for certain varieties of cocoa beans, these average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of the Corporations  average cost of cocoa beans or cocoa products. 2    Cocoa Futures Contract Prices (cents per pound)   Source:   International Cocoa Organization Quarterly Bulletin of Cocoa Statistics Cocoa market prices rose sharply during 2002 and this increase accelerated following a rebellion in the worlds largest cocoa producing country, the Ivory Coast. Continued civil unrest in the Ivory Coast could result in further cocoa price increases. The Corporations costs during 2003 and beyond will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of its forward purchasing practices, premiums and discounts reflective of relative values, varying delivery times, and supply and demand for specific varieties and grades of cocoa beans. The Corporations costs for cocoa will increase substantially in 2004; however, the Corporation expects to achieve its long-term goals for growth and profitability by a combination of possible price increases and/or product weight changes, improved sales mix, supply chain cost reductions and strict control of other costs to offset potential cost increases and respond to changes in the competitive environment.  The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, which is a six-year farm bill, impacts the prices of sugar, corn, peanuts and milk because it sets price support levels for these commodities.  The price of sugar, the Corporations second most important commodity for its domestic chocolate and confectionery products, is subject to price supports under the above referenced farm legislation. Due to import quotas and duties imposed to support the price of sugar established by that legislation, sugar prices paid by United States users are currently substantially higher than prices on the world sugar market. The average wholesale list price of refined sugar, F.O.B. Northeast, has remained in a range of 25 ¢ to 32 ¢ per pound for the past ten years. U.S. peanut prices declined approximately 25 percent during the fourth quarter of 2002 due to a decrease in price support levels. Almond prices remained near normal levels throughout 2002. Milk prices decreased in 2002 as a result of increasing milk production. The Corporation believes that the supply of raw materials is adequate to meet its manufacturing requirements.  The Corporation attempts to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of its major raw materials primarily through forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements, generally for periods from 3 to 24 months. With regard to cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, fuel oil and certain dairy products, price risks are also managed by entering into futures contracts. At the present time, active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing the Corporations other major raw material requirements. Futures contracts are used in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweetener, natural gas and certain dairy product requirements principally to take advantage of market fluctuations which provide more favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing these raw materials and energy requirements. Fuel oil futures contracts are used to minimize price fluctuations associated with the Corporations transportation costs. The Corporations commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases, but also may potentially limit the ability to benefit from possible price decreases.  The primary effect on liquidity from using futures contracts is associated with margin requirements for futures contracts related to cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, fuel oil and certain dairy products. Cash outflows and inflows result from original margins which are good faith deposits established by futures exchanges to ensure that market participants will meet their contractual financial obligations. Additionally, variation margin payments and receipts are required when the value of open positions is adjusted to reflect daily price movements. The magnitude of such cash inflows and outflows is dependent upon price coverage levels and the volatility of the markets. Cash flows related to margin requirements were significant during 2002 as a result of unusual volatility in market prices, but historically, have not been material to the Corporations total working capital requirements.  The Corporation manages the purchase of forward and futures contracts by developing and monitoring procurement strategies for each of its major commodities. These procurement strategies, including the use of futures contracts to hedge the pricing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, transportation costs and certain dairy products, are directly linked to the overall planning and management of the Corporations business, since the cost of raw materials, energy and transportation accounts for a significant portion of cost of sales. Procurement strategies with regard to cocoa, sugar and other major raw material requirements, energy requirements and transportation costs are developed by the analysis of fundamentals, including weather and crop analysis, other imbalances between supply and demand, currency exchange rates, political unrest in producing countries and speculative influences, and by discussions with market analysts,  3  brokers and dealers. Procurement strategies are determined, implemented and monitored on a regular basis by senior management. Procurement activities for all major commodities are also reported to the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Competition Many of the Corporations brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among the leading brands sold in the marketplace. However, these brands are sold in highly competitive markets and compete with many other multinational, national, regional and local firms, some of which have resources in excess of those available to the Corporation.  Trademarks The Corporation owns various registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks, and has rights under licenses to use various trademarks that are of material importance to the Corporations business.  Backlog of Orders The Corporation manufactures primarily for stock and fills customer orders from finished goods inventories. While at any given time there may be some backlog of orders, such backlog is not material in respect to total annual sales, nor are the changes from time to time significant, aside from the third quarter of 1999 when a significant backlog of orders resulted from customer service and order fulfillment problems encountered during the start-up of new business systems and processes.  Research and Development The Corporation engages in a variety of research activities. These principally involve development of new products, improvement in the quality of existing products, improvement and modernization of production processes, and the development and implementation of new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed product lines. Information concerning the Corporations research and development expense is contained in Note 1 of the Corporations Annual Report to Stockholders included as Appendix A to the Proxy Statement, which information is incorporated herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 13 hereto.  Regulation The Corporations domestic plants are subject to inspection by the Food and Drug Administration and various other governmental agencies, and its products must comply with regulations under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and with various comparable state statutes regulating the manufacturing and marketing of food products.  Environmental Considerations In the past the Corporation has made investments based on compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Such expenditures have not been material with respect to the Corporations capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.  Employees As of December 31, 2002, the Corporation had approximately 13,700 full-time and 1,700 part-time employees, of whom approximately 5,600 were covered by collective bargaining agreements. A reduction of approximately 500 full-time employees occurred during 2002 as a result of a voluntary work force reduction program. A collective bargaining agreement covering approximately 3,000 employees at two of the Corporations principal plants in Hershey, Pennsylvania expired in November 2001. On February 27, 2002, the employees voted not to ratify a new contract offer, despite recommendations by their union negotiating committee and executive board to approve the new contract. On April 17, 2002, the employees voted again not to ratify an amended contract offer following the rejection of that offer by the union negotiating committee. The Corporation and union representatives continued negotiations with the assistance of a federal mediator, but no settlement was reached and the employees went on strike beginning April 26, 2002. The strike ended on June 6, 2002, when the employees voted to ratify a new contract, with employees returning to work beginning on June 8, 2002. The work stoppage did not have a material impact on the Corporations results of operations for 2002. The Corporation considers its employee relations to be good.  4  Financial Information by Geographic Area Information concerning the Corporations geographic segments is contained in Note 18 of the Corporations Annual Report to Stockholders included as Appendix A to the Proxy Statement, which information is incorporated herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 13 hereto.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In January 1999, the Corporation received a Notice of Proposed Deficiency (Notice) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to the years 1989 through 1996. The Notice pertained to the Corporate Owned Life Insurance (COLI) program that was implemented by the Corporation in 1989. The IRS disallowed the interest expense deductions associated with the underlying life insurance policies. The total deficiency of $61.2 million, including interest, was paid to the IRS in September 2000 to eliminate further accruing of interest. Effective October 1, 2001, the Corporation negotiated a settlement with the IRS regarding the Notice. The resulting Closing Agreement with the IRS limited the COLI interest expense deductions for all applicable tax years and resulted in the surrender of all insurance   5  policies, thereby ending the COLI program. The settlement is a complete resolution of all federal and state tax aspects of this program. The Corporation has no other material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business.  Item 4.

Directors who are employees of the Corporation receive no remuneration for their services as directors. RSUs are granted quarterly to each director on the first day of January, April, July, and October on the basis of the number of shares of Common Stock, valued at the average closing price on the New York Stock Exchange of the Common Stock on the last three trading days preceding the grant, equal to $10,000. While the value of the annual RSU grant is targeted at $40,000, the actual value of the grant may be higher or lower depending upon the performance of the Common Stock following the grant dates. A directors RSUs will vest and be distributed upon his or her retirement from the Board. Directors may elect to receive all or a portion of their retainer in cash or Common Stock, although committee chair fees are paid only in cash. A director may defer receipt of the retainer and committee chair fees until his or her retirement from the Board.     Item 13.
