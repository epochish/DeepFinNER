DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE           The Companys Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2003, included as Appendix A to the Companys Proxy Statement for the Companys 2004 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the Proxy Statement) and attached hereto and filed as Exhibit 13, is incorporated by reference herein into portions of Part I and Part II. Portions of the Proxy Statement are incorporated by reference herein into Part III.     PART I   Item 1.   BUSINESS           Hershey Foods Corporation, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and entities in which it has a controlling financial interest (the Company) are engaged in the manufacture, distribution and sale of confectionery and grocery products. The Company was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 24, 1927, as a successor to a business founded in 1894 by Milton S. Hershey.           In July 2003, the Company announced a number of initiatives continuing its value-enhancing strategy. These initiatives included realigning the sales organization and streamlining the supply chain by divesting or eliminating certain non-strategic brands and products and by product line rationalization. In September 2003, the Company completed the sale of a group of the Companys gum brands to Farleys & Sathers Candy Company, Inc. for $20.0 million in cash as part of its business realignment initiatives. Included in the transaction were the FRUIT STRIPE, RAIN-BLO and SUPER BUBBLE trademarked gum brands.           The Companys principal product groups include: confectionery products sold in the form of bar goods, bagged items and boxed items; and grocery products in the form of baking ingredients, chocolate drink mixes, peanut butter, dessert toppings and beverages. The Company believes it is a leader in many of these product groups in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Operating profit margins vary considerably among individual products and brands. Generally, such margins on confectionery products are greater than those on grocery products.           The Company manufactures confectionery products in a variety of packaged forms and markets them under more than 50 brands. The different packaged forms include various arrangements of the same bar products, such as boxes, trays and bags, as well as a variety of different sizes and weights of the same bar products, such as snack size, standard, king size, large and giant bars. Among the principal confectionery products in the United States are: HERSHEYS COOKIES N CREME candy bars, HERSHEYS HUGS chocolates, HERSHEYS KISSES chocolates, HERSHEYS KISSES chocolates with almonds, HERSHEYS chocolate bars, HERSHEYS chocolate bars with almonds, HERSHEYS MINIATURES chocolate bars, HERSHEYS NUGGETS chocolates, HERSHEYS SMORES candy bars, HERSHEYS sugar free candies, COOL BLAST mints, FAST BREAK candy bars, ICE BREAKERS mints and chewing gum, JOLLY RANCHER candy, KIT KAT and KIT KAT BIG KAT wafer bars, KRACKEL chocolate bars, MR. GOODBAR chocolate bars, REESES NUTRAGEOUS candy bars, REESES peanut butter cups, REESES PIECES candies, REESES sugar free peanut butter cups miniatures, REESESTICKS wafer bars, SPECIAL DARK chocolate bars, SWOOPS chocolate slices and SYMPHONY chocolate bars. Other confectionery products include: HERSHEYS BITES candies, ALMOND JOY candy bars, BREATH SAVERS mints, BUBBLE YUM bubble gum, CARAMELLO candy bars, KOOLERZ chewing gum, GOOD & PLENTY candy, HEATH toffee bars, MILK DUDS candy, MOUNDS candy bars, PAYDAY candy bars, POT OF GOLD boxed chocolates, ROLO caramels in milk chocolate, SKOR toffee bars, TWIZZLERS candy, WHATCHAMACALLIT candy bars, WHOPPERS malted milk balls, YORK peppermint pattie candy, 5TH AVENUE candy bars and ZERO candy bars.           The Company also manufactures and/or markets grocery products in the baking, beverage, peanut butter and toppings categories. Principal products in the United States include HERSHEYS, REESES and HEATH baking pieces, HERSHEYS chocolate milk mix, HERSHEYS cocoa, HERSHEYS CHOCOLATE SHOPPE ice cream toppings, HERSHEYS HOT COCOA COLLECTION hot cocoa mix, HERSHEYS syrup and REESES peanut butter. HERSHEYS chocolate and strawberry flavored milks are produced and sold under license by various dairies throughout the United States, using milk mixes manufactured by the Company. Baking and various other products are produced and sold under the HERSHEYS and REESES brand names by third parties that have been granted licenses by the Company to use these trademarks.           Principal products in Canada include CHIPITS chocolate chips, GLOSETTE chocolate-covered raisins, peanuts and almonds, OH HENRY! candy bars, POT OF GOLD boxed chocolates, REESE PEANUT BUTTER CUPS candy and TWIZZLERS candy. The Company also manufactures, imports, markets, sells and distributes chocolate products in Mexico under the HERSHEYS brand name.           The Company has license agreements with several companies to manufacture and/or sell products worldwide. Among the more significant are agreements with affiliated companies of Cadbury Schweppes p.l.c. to manufacture and/or market and distribute YORK, PETER PAUL ALMOND JOY and PETER PAUL MOUNDS confectionery products worldwide as well as CADBURY and CARAMELLO confectionery products in the United States. The Companys rights under these agreements are extendible on a long-term basis at the Companys option. The license for CADBURY and CARAMELLO products is subject to a minimum sales requirement that the Company exceeded in 2003. The Company also has an agreement with Societe des Produits Nestle SA, which licenses the Company to manufacture and distribute KIT KAT and ROLO confectionery products in the United States. The Companys rights under this agreement are extendible on a long-term basis at the Companys option, subject to certain conditions, including minimum unit volume sales. In 2003, the minimum unit volume requirements were exceeded. The Company has an agreement with an affiliate of Huhtamäki Oy (Huhtamaki) pursuant to which it licenses the use of certain trademarks, including GOOD & PLENTY,HEATH, JOLLY RANCHER, MILK DUDS, PAYDAY and 1            WHOPPERS for confectionery products worldwide. The Companys rights under this agreement are extendible on a long-term basis at the Companys option.           The Companys products are sold primarily to grocery wholesalers, chain grocery stores, candy distributors, mass merchandisers, chain drug stores, vending companies, wholesale clubs, convenience stores, concessionaires and food distributors by full-time sales representatives, food brokers and part-time retail sales merchandisers throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. The Company believes its products are sold in over 2 million retail outlets in North America. In 2003, sales to McLane Company, Inc., formerly a subsidiary of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., amounted to approximately 22 percent of the Company's total sales.           The Company manufactures, imports, markets, sells and distributes chocolate products in Brazil under the HERSHEYS brand name. Additional products in Brazil include IO-IO hazelnut crème items and chocolate and confectionery products sold under the VISCONTI brand name. In China, Japan, Korea and the Philippines, the Company imports and/or markets selected confectionery and grocery products. The Company also markets confectionery and grocery products in over 60 countries worldwide.           The Companys marketing strategy is based upon the consistently superior quality of its products, mass distribution and the best possible consumer value in terms of price and weight. In addition, the Company devotes considerable resources to the identification, development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of new products. The Company utilizes a variety of promotional programs for customers as well as advertising and promotional programs for consumers. The Company employs promotional programs at various times during the year to stimulate sales of certain products. Confectionery and grocery seasonal and holiday-related sales have typically been highest during the third and fourth quarters of the year.           The Company recognizes that the mass distribution of its confectionery and grocery products is an important element in maintaining sales growth and providing service to its customers. The Company attempts to meet the changing demands of its customers by planning optimum stock levels and reasonable delivery times consistent with achievement of efficiencies in distribution. To achieve these objectives, the Company has developed a distribution network from its manufacturing plants, distribution centers and field warehouses strategically located throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. The Company uses a combination of public and contract carriers to deliver its products from the distribution points to its customers. In conjunction with sales and marketing efforts, the distribution system has been instrumental in the effective promotion of new, as well as established, products on both national and regional scales.           From time to time, the Company has changed the prices and weights of its products to accommodate changes in manufacturing costs, the competitive environment and profit objectives, while at the same time maintaining consumer value. The Company implemented an increase in the wholesale price of its domestic standard size, king size, variety pack, 6-pack and 10-pack lines effective January 1, 2003. The standard size increase was approximately 11 percent. The effect of all the increases translated into an approximate 3 percent increase over the entire domestic product line. The last standard candy bar price increase was implemented by the Company in December 1995.           The most significant raw material used in the production of the Companys chocolate products is cocoa beans. This commodity is imported principally from Far Eastern, West African and South American equatorial regions. West Africa accounts for approximately 70 percent of the worlds crop. Cocoa beans are not uniform, and the various grades and varieties reflect the diverse agricultural practices and natural conditions found in the many growing areas. The Company buys a mix of cocoa beans and cocoa products to meet its manufacturing requirements.           The table below sets forth annual average cocoa prices as well as the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated. The prices are the monthly average of the quotations at noon of the three active futures trading contracts closest to maturity on the New York Board of Trade. Because of the Companys forward purchasing practices discussed below, and premium prices paid for certain varieties of cocoa beans, these average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of the Companys average cost of cocoa beans or cocoa products.   Cocoa Futures Contract Prices  (cents per pound)     Source: International Cocoa Organization Quarterly Bulletin of Cocoa Statistics  2           After rising sharply in 2002, cocoa market prices reached an eighteen-year high in February 2003, before gradually declining, but remaining at levels somewhat higher than prices prior to 2002. Continued civil unrest in the worlds largest cocoa-producing country, the Ivory Coast, has resulted in volatile market conditions, but has not materially affected the harvesting and marketing of the cocoa crop. The Companys costs during 2004 and beyond will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of its forward purchasing practices, premiums and discounts reflective of relative values, varying delivery times, and supply and demand for specific varieties and grades of cocoa beans. The Companys costs for cocoa will increase substantially in 2004; however, the Company expects to achieve its goals for growth and profitability over the foreseeable future by a combination of improved sales mix, supply chain cost reductions and strict control of other costs to offset cost increases and respond to changes in the competitive environment.           The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, which is a six-year farm bill, impacts the prices of sugar, corn, peanuts and milk because it sets price support levels for these commodities.           The price of sugar, the Companys second most important commodity for its domestic chocolate and confectionery products, is subject to price supports under the above referenced farm legislation. Due to import quotas and duties imposed to support the price of sugar established by that legislation, sugar prices paid by United States users are currently substantially higher than prices on the world sugar market. The average wholesale list price of refined sugar, F.O.B. Northeast, has remained in a range of 25¢ to 32¢ per pound for the past ten years. United States peanut prices traded around 40¢ per pound during 2003 and are expected to remain near that level in 2004. Almond prices began strengthening during the second quarter of 2003 and continued to increase during the second half of the year due to strong global demand and a weakening U.S. dollar. Prices began the year at $1.50 per pound, were at $2.00 per pound as of December 31, 2003, and are expected to remain firm during 2004. Milk prices remained low in 2003 as a result of higher than normal inventories of butter and skim milk powder. Prices began to increase late in the fourth quarter as milk and butter production fell below year earlier levels, and butter inventories declined. Milk prices in 2004 are expected to increase moderately from 2003 levels. The Company believes that the supply of raw materials is adequate to meet its manufacturing requirements.           The Company attempts to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of its major raw materials primarily through forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements, generally for periods from 3 to 24 months. With regard to cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, fuel oil and certain dairy products, price risks are also managed by entering into futures contracts. At the present time, active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing the Companys other major raw material requirements. Futures contracts are used in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweetener, natural gas and certain dairy product requirements principally to take advantage of market fluctuations that provide more favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing these raw materials and energy requirements. Fuel oil futures contracts are used to minimize price fluctuations associated with the Companys transportation costs. The Companys commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases, but also may potentially limit the ability to benefit from possible price decreases.           The primary effect on liquidity from using futures contracts is associated with margin requirements for futures contracts related to cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, fuel oil and certain dairy products. Cash outflows and inflows result from original margins that are good faith deposits established by futures exchanges to ensure that market participants will meet their contractual financial obligations. Additionally, variation margin payments and receipts are required when the value of open positions is adjusted to reflect daily price movements. The magnitude of such cash inflows and outflows is dependent upon price coverage levels and the volatility of the markets. Cash flows related to margin requirements historically have not been material to the Companys total working capital requirements.           The Company manages the purchase of forward and futures contracts by developing and monitoring procurement strategies for each of its major commodities. These procurement strategies, including the use of futures contracts to hedge the pricing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, transportation costs and certain dairy products, are directly linked to the overall planning and management of the Companys business, since the cost of raw materials, energy and transportation accounts for a significant portion of cost of sales. Procurement strategies with regard to cocoa, sugar and other major raw material requirements, energy requirements and transportation costs are developed by the analysis of fundamentals, including weather and crop analysis, imbalances between supply and demand, currency exchange rates, political unrest in producing countries and speculative influences and by discussions with market analysts, brokers and dealers. Procurement strategies are determined, implemented and monitored on a regular basis by senior management. Procurement activities for all major commodities are also reported to the Companys Board of Directors (the Board) on a regular basis.   Competition           Many of the Companys brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among the leading brands sold in the marketplace. However, these brands are sold in highly competitive markets and compete with many other multinational, national, regional and local firms, some of which have resources in excess of those available to the Company.   3   Trademarks           The Company owns various registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks and has rights under licenses to use various trademarks that are of material importance to the Companys business.   Backlog of Orders           The Company manufactures primarily for stock and fills customer orders from finished goods inventories. While at any given time there may be some backlog of orders, such backlog is not material in respect to total annual sales, nor are the changes from time to time significant.   Research and Development           The Company engages in a variety of research activities. These principally involve development of new products, improvement in the quality of existing products, improvement and modernization of production processes and the development and implementation of new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed product lines. Information concerning the Companys research and development expense is contained in Note 1 of the Companys Annual Report to Stockholders, attached hereto and filed as Exhibit 13 and incorporated herein by reference.   Regulation           The Companys domestic plants are subject to inspection by the Food and Drug Administration and various other governmental agencies, and its products must comply with regulations under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and with various comparable state statutes regulating the manufacturing and marketing of food products.   Environmental Considerations           In the past the Company has made investments based on compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Such expenditures have not been material with respect to the Companys capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.   Employees           As of December 31, 2003, the Company had approximately 13,100 full-time and 1,700 part-time employees, of whom approximately 5,200 were covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company considers its employee relations to be good.
