DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE            The  Corporations  Annual Report to  Stockholders  for the year ended December  31, 2001 is included  as  Appendix A to the  Corporations  Proxy Statement for the  Corporations  2002 Annual Meeting of Stockholders  (the Proxy  Statement)  and is incorporated by reference into Part II and filed as Exhibit 13 hereto.  Portions of the Proxy Statement are incorporated by reference herein into Part III.     PART I Item 1.      BUSINESS               Hershey     Foods     Corporation     and     its     subsidiaries     (the Corporation)  are engaged in the manufacture,  distribution and sale of consumer food products. The Corporation produces and distributes a broad line of chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery and grocery products.                The  Corporation  was organized  under the laws of the State of Delaware on October  24,  1927,  as a successor  to a business  founded in 1894 by Milton S. Hershey.               In July  2001,  the  Corporations  Brazilian  subsidiary,  Hershey do Brasil,  acquired the chocolate and confectionery  business of Visagis for $17.1 million.  Included in the acquisition  were the  IO-IO  brand of hazelnut crème  items and the  chocolate and  confectionery  products sold under the VISCONTI  brand. Also included in the purchase were a manufacturing plant and  confectionery  equipment in Sao Roque,  Brazil.  This business had sales of approximately $20 million in 2000.                In   September   2001,   the   Corporation   completed   the  sale  of  its LUDENS  throat drops business to Pharmacia Consumer  Healthcare,  a unit of  Pharmacia  Corporation.  Included in the sale were the  trademarks  and manufacturing equipment for the throat drops business.  Under a supply agreement with Pharmacia, the Corporation agreed to manufacture LUDENS throat drops for up to 19  months  after the date of sale.  Under a  separate  services agreement,  the Corporation agreed to continue to sell, warehouse and distribute LUDENS throat drops through March 2002.                In October  2001,  the  Corporation  announced  initiatives  to enhance its future  operating  performance  by focusing on profitable  sales  growth, ongoing   improvement  of  margins  and  asset   management  and  a  more streamlined,  results-driven organization. A charge to cost of sales, along with a business   realignment  and  asset  impairment   charge,   totaling   $278.4 million  before  tax, or $1.25 per share - diluted,  were recorded in the fourth  quarter of 2001 to support the  initiatives.  Additional  charges of approximately  $31.6  million before tax, or $.14 per share  diluted,  are expected to be recorded in 2002.  These  initiatives will generate ongoing  annual  savings of $75 million to $80 million  when fully  implemented, which will be reinvested to enhance  marketing  and selling  capabilities.  Cash flows  for the  business  have  increased  as a  result  of  these  initiatives.                The charge to cost of sales primarily included costs related to selling and  reducing  raw material  inventories,  principally  cocoa beans and cocoa butter,  no longer required to support operations.  The business realignment and  asset  impairments   charge  included  costs  related  to  outsourcing  the production of cocoa powder, the elimination of certain non-strategic brands, the elimination of underutilized capacity through the closure of three manufacturing facilities and one distribution  center,  realignment of the sales organization, and a voluntary work force reduction program.                The  Corporations  principal  product groups  include:  chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery products sold in the form of bar goods, bagged items and  boxed  items;  and  grocery  products  in the form of  baking  ingredients, chocolate  drink mixes,  peanut  butter,  dessert  toppings and  beverages.  The Corporation  believes it is a leader in these product  groups in North  America. Operating profit margins vary considerably among individual products and brands. Generally,  such margins on chocolate and non-chocolate  confectionery  products are greater than those on grocery products.                In North America, the Corporation  manufactures chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery  products  in a variety of packaged  forms and markets  them under more than 50 brands. The different  packaged forms include various  arrangements of the same bar products, such as boxes, trays and bags, as well as a variety of different  sizes  and  weights  of the same bar  products,  such as snack  size, standard,  king size,  large and giant bars.  Among the principal  chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery products in the United States are: HERSHEYS BITES candies,  HERSHEYS  classic  caramels,  HERSHEYS COOKIES   N CREME  chocolate  bars,   HERSHEYS HUGS chocolates, HERSHEYS KISSES chocolates,  HERSHEYS KISSES  WITH  ALMONDS  chocolates,   HERSHEYS  chocolate  bars, HERSHEYS    chocolate   bars   with   almonds,    HERSHEYS MINIATURES   chocolate  bars,   HERSHEYS   NUGGETS  chocolates, ALMOND JOY candy bars,  BREATH SAVERS mints, BREATH SAVERS COOL BLASTS  mints,  BUBBLE YUM bubble gum,  CARAMELLO  candy bars, CAREFREE  and FRUIT  STRIPE  chewing gum, FAST  BREAK candy bars,  GOOD &  PLENTY  candy,  HEATH toffee bar, ICE  BREAKERS mints and chewing gum, JOLLY  RANCHER  candy,  KIT KAT wafer bars, KRACKEL  chocolate  bars,  MILK DUDS  chocolate  covered caramels, MOUNDS candy bars, MR.

Principal  products in Canada  include  CHIPITS chocolate chips, GLOSETTE chocolate-covered raisins, peanuts and almonds, OH HENRY! candy bars,  POT OF GOLD boxed  chocolates,  REESE PEANUT BUTTER CUPS candy, and  TWIZZLERS  candy. The Corporation also manufactures,  imports,  markets,  sells and distributes  chocolate  products in Mexico under the HERSHEYS brand name.          The Corporation manufactures and/or markets a line of grocery products in the baking, beverage, peanut butter and toppings categories. Principal products in the United States include HERSHEYS, REESES and HEATH baking pieces, HERSHEYS drink boxes, HERSHEYS chocolate milk mix, HERSHEYS cocoa, HERSHEYS CHOCOLATE SHOPPE ice cream toppings, HERSHEYS HOT COCOA COLLECTION hot cocoa mix, HERSHEYS syrup and REESES peanut butter. HERSHEYS chocolate and strawberry flavored milks are produced and sold under license by various dairies throughout the United States, using milk mixes manufactured by the Corporation. Baking and various other products are produced and sold under the HERSHEYS and REESES brand names by third parties who have been granted licenses by the Corporation to use these trademarks.          The Corporation has license agreements with several companies to manufacture and/or sell products worldwide. Among the more significant are agreements with affiliated companies of Cadbury Schweppes p.l.c. to manufacture and/or market and distribute YORK, PETER PAUL ALMOND JOY and PETER PAUL MOUNDS confectionery products worldwide as well as CADBURY and CARAMELLO confectionery products in the United States. The Corporations rights under these agreements are extendible on a long-term basis at the Corporations option. The license for CADBURY and CARAMELLO products is subject to a minimum sales requirement which the Corporation exceeded in 2001. The Corporation also has an agreement with Societe des Produits Nestle SA, which licenses the Corporation to manufacture and distribute KIT KAT and ROLO confectionery products in the United States. The Corporations rights under this agreement are extendible on a long-term basis at the Corporations option, subject to certain conditions, including minimum unit volume sales. In 2001, the minimum volume requirements were exceeded. The Corporation has an agreement with an affiliate of Huhtamäki Oy (Huhtamaki) pursuant to which it licenses the use of certain trademarks, including GOOD & PLENTY, HEATH, JOLLY RANCHER, MILK DUDS, PAYDAY and WHOPPERS confectionery products worldwide. The Corporations rights under this agreement are extendible on a long-term basis at the Corporations option.          The Corporations products are sold primarily to grocery wholesalers, chain grocery stores, candy distributors, mass merchandisers, chain drug stores, vending companies, wholesale clubs, convenience stores, concessionaires and food distributors by full-time sales representatives, food brokers and part-time retail sales merchandisers throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. The Corporation believes its products are sold in over 2 million retail outlets in North America. In 2001, sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries amounted to approximately 18% of the Corporations total net sales.          In Argentina, Brazil, China, Japan, Korea, and the Philippines, the Corporation imports and/or markets selected confectionery and grocery products. The Corporation also markets confectionery and grocery products in over 90 countries worldwide.          The Corporations marketing strategy is based upon the consistently superior quality of its products, mass distribution and the best possible consumer value in terms of price and weight. In addition, the Corporation devotes considerable resources to the identification, development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of new products. The Corporation utilizes a variety of promotional programs for customers and advertising and promotional programs for consumers. The Corporation employs promotional programs at various times during the year to stimulate sales of certain products. Chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery and grocery seasonal and holiday-related sales have typically been highest during the third and fourth quarters of the year.          The Corporation recognizes that the mass distribution of its consumer food products is an important element in maintaining sales growth and providing service to its customers. The Corporation attempts to meet the changing demands of its customers by planning optimum stock levels and reasonable delivery times consistent with achievement of efficiencies in distribution. To achieve these objectives, the Corporation has developed a distribution network from its manufacturing plants, distribution centers and field warehouses strategically located throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. The Corporation uses a combination of public and contract carriers to deliver its products from the distribution points to its customers. In conjunction with sales and marketing efforts, the distribution system has been instrumental in the effective promotion of new, as well as established, products on both national and regional scales.   2                                                From time to time, the Corporation has changed the prices and weights of its products to accommodate changes in manufacturing costs, the competitive environment and profit objectives, while at the same time maintaining consumer value. The last standard candy bar price increase was implemented by the Corporation in December 1995, resulting in a wholesale price increase of approximately 11% on its standard and king-size candy bars sold in the United States.          The most significant raw material used in the production of the Corporations chocolate products is cocoa beans. This commodity is imported principally from West African, South American and Far Eastern equatorial regions. West Africa accounts for approximately 70% of the worlds crop. Cocoa beans are not uniform, and the various grades and varieties reflect the diverse agricultural practices and natural conditions found in the many growing areas. The Corporation buys a mix of cocoa beans to meet its manufacturing requirements.          The table below sets forth annual average cocoa prices as well as the highest and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated. The prices are the monthly average of the quotations at noon of the three active futures trading contracts closest to maturity on the New York Board of Trade. Because of the Corporations forward purchasing practices discussed below, and premium prices paid for certain varieties of cocoa beans, these average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of the Corporations average cost of cocoa beans or cocoa products.    Cocoa Futures Contract Prices  (cents per pound)             Source:   International Cocoa Organization Quarterly Bulletin of Cocoa Statistics          The  Federal  Agricultural  and  Improvement  Reform  Act of  1996,  which  is a seven-year farm bill,  impacts the prices of sugar,  peanuts and milk because it sets price support levels for these commodities.           The price of sugar, the  Corporations  second most important commodity for its domestic chocolate and confectionery  products, is subject to price supports under the above  referenced  farm  legislation.  Due to import quotas and duties imposed to support the price of sugar  established  by that  legislation,  sugar prices  paid by United  States  users are  currently  substantially  higher than prices on the world sugar market.  The average  wholesale  list price of refined sugar, F.O.B.  Northeast,  has remained in a range of 25¢  to 32¢  per pound for the past ten years.  Peanut and almond  prices  remained  near  normal levels  throughout  2001. Milk prices increased in 2001 as a result of declining milk  production.  The Corporation  believes that the supply of raw materials is adequate to meet its manufacturing requirements.           The  Corporation  attempts to minimize the effect of future  price  fluctuations related to the purchase of its major raw  materials  primarily  through  forward purchasing  to cover future  manufacturing  requirements,  generally for periods from 3 to 24 months. With regard to cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners,  natural gas, fuel oil and certain  dairy  products,  price risks are also managed by entering into futures  contracts.  At the present time,  active futures contracts are not available  for use in pricing the  Corporations  other major raw  material requirements.  Futures contracts are used in combination with forward purchasing of  cocoa,  sugar,  corn  sweetener,  natural  gas  and  certain  dairy  product requirements  principally to take advantage of market fluctuations which provide more  favorable  pricing  opportunities  and  flexibility  in sourcing these raw materials  and  energy  requirements.  Fuel oil  futures  contracts  are used to minimize   price   fluctuations    associated   with   the    Corporations transportation costs. The Corporations commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases,  but also may potentially limit the ability to benefit from possible price decreases.          The primary effect on liquidity from using futures contracts is associated with margin requirements for futures contracts related to cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, fuel oil and certain dairy products. Cash outflows and inflows result from original margins which are good faith deposits  established by futures exchanges to ensure that market participants will meet their contractual financial obligations. Additionally, variation margin payments and receipts are required when the value of open positions is adjusted to reflect daily price movements. The magnitude of such cash inflows and outflows is dependent upon price coverage levels and the volatility of the markets. Historically, cash flows related to margin requirements have not been material to the Corporations total working capital requirements.                                         3          The Corporation manages the purchase of forward and futures contracts by developing and monitoring procurement strategies for each of its major commodities. These procurement strategies, including the use of futures contracts to hedge the pricing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, transportation costs and certain dairy products, are directly linked to the overall planning and management of the Corporations business, since the cost of raw materials, energy and transportation accounts for a significant portion of cost of sales. Procurement strategies with regard to cocoa, sugar and other major raw material requirements, energy requirements, and transportation costs are developed by the analysis of fundamentals, including weather and crop analysis, and by discussions with market analysts, brokers and dealers. Procurement strategies are determined, implemented and monitored on a regular basis by senior management. Procurement activities for all major commodities are also reported to the Board of Directors on a regular basis.  Competition         Many of the Corporations brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among the leading brands sold in the marketplace. However, these brands are sold in highly competitive markets and compete with many other multinational, national, regional and local firms, some of which have resources in excess of those available to the Corporation.  Trademarks         The Corporation owns various registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks, and has rights under licenses to use various trademarks which are of material importance to the Corporations business.  Backlog of Orders         The Corporation manufactures primarily for stock and fills customer orders from finished goods inventories. While at any given time there may be some backlog of orders, such backlog is not material in respect to total annual sales, nor are the changes from time to time significant, aside from the third quarter of 1999 when a significant backlog of orders resulted from customer service and order fulfillment problems encountered during the start-up of new business systems and processes.  Research and Development         The Corporation engages in a variety of research activities. These principally involve development of new products, improvement in the quality of existing products, improvement and modernization of production processes, and the development and implementation of new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed product lines. Information concerning the Corporations research and development expense is contained in Note 1 of the Corporations Annual Report to Stockholders included as Appendix A to the Proxy Statement, which information is incorporated herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 13 hereto.  Regulation         The Corporations domestic plants are subject to inspection by the Food and Drug Administration and various other governmental agencies, and its products must comply with regulations under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and with various comparable state statutes regulating the manufacturing and marketing of food products.  Environmental Considerations         In the past the Corporation has made investments based on compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Such expenditures have not been material with respect to the Corporations capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.  Employees          As of December 31, 2001, the Corporation had approximately  14,400 full-time and 1,600  part-time  employees,   of  whom  approximately  6,000  were  covered  by collective bargaining  agreements.  In 2002, the Corporation expects a reduction of approximately  600 full-time  employees as a result of a voluntary work force reduction program. The Corporation  considers its employee relations to be good. It should be noted that a collective bargaining agreement covering approximately 3,000  employees  at two of  the  Corporation's  principal  plants  in  Hershey, Pennsylvania expired in November 2001. On February 27, 2002, the employees voted not to ratify a new  contract  offer,  despite  recommendations  by their  union negotiating committee and executive board to approve the new five-year contract. The  Corporation  and the union  negotiating  committee  have agreed to seek the assistance of a federal mediator.                                         4  Financial Information by Geographic Area         Information concerning the Corporations geographic segments is contained in Note 17 of the Corporations Annual Report to Stockholders included as Appendix A to the Proxy Statement, which information is incorporated herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 13 hereto.  Safe Harbor Statement         The nature of the Corporations operations and the environment in which it operates subject it to changing economic, competitive, regulatory and technological conditions, risks and uncertainties. In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Corporation notes the following factors which, among others, could cause future results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, expectations and assumptions expressed or implied herein. Many of the forward-looking statements contained in this document may be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as believe, expect, anticipate, should, planned, estimated, and potential, among others. Factors which could cause results to differ include, but are not limited to: changes in the confectionery and grocery business environment, including actions of competitors and changes in consumer preferences; changes in governmental laws and regulations, including taxes; market demand for new and existing products; changes in raw material and other costs; the Corporations ability to implement improvements to and reduce costs associated with the Corporations distribution operations; pension cost factors, such as actuarial assumptions and employee retirement decisions; and the Corporations ability to sell certain assets at targeted values.  Item 2.    PROPERTIES              The  following  is a list  of  the  Corporation's  principal  manufacturing properties. The Corporation owns each of these properties.           UNITED STATES                  Hershey, Pennsylvania - confectionery and grocery products              (3 principal plants)                 Lancaster, Pennsylvania - confectionery products                 Oakdale, California - confectionery and grocery products                 Robinson, Illinois - confectionery and grocery products                 Stuarts Draft, Virginia - confectionery and grocery products                       CANADA                  Smiths Falls, Ontario - confectionery and grocery products                       In addition to the  locations  indicated  above,  the  Corporation  owns or leases  several  other   properties   used  for   manufacturing   chocolate  and non-chocolate confectionery and grocery products and for sales, distribution and administrative functions.           The  Corporation's  plants are efficient and well maintained.  These plants generally have adequate capacity and can accommodate seasonal demands,  changing product mixes and certain  additional  growth. The largest plants are located in Hershey,  Pennsylvania.  Many additions and improvements have been made to these facilities  over the  years and the  plants'  manufacturing  equipment  includes equipment of the latest type and technology. Item 3.        LEGAL PROCEEDINGS       In January 1999, the Corporation received a Notice of Proposed Deficiency (Notice) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to the years 1989 through  1996.  The Notice  pertained to the Corporate Owned Life Insurance  (COLI) program which was implemented by the Corporation in 1989. The IRS disallowed the interest  expense  deductions  associated  with the underlying  life  insurance  policies.  The total  deficiency of $61.2  million, including  interest,  was paid to the IRS in September 2000 to eliminate further accruing of interest.  Effective  October 1, 2001, the Corporation  negotiated a settlement with the IRS regarding the Notice.  The resulting  Closing  Agreement with the IRS limited the COLI interest expense deductions for all applicable tax years and resulted in the surrender of all insurance  policies,  thereby  ending the COLI program.  The  settlement  is a complete  resolution of all federal and state tax aspects of this program. The Corporation has no other material pending legal  proceedings,  other than ordinary  routine  litigation  incidental to its business. Item 4.
