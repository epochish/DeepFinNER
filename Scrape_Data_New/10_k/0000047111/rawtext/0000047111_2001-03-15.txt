DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE  The Corporations Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2000 is included as Appendix A to the Corporations Proxy Statement for the  Corporations  2001 Annual Meeting of  Stockholders  (the  Proxy Statement)  and is  incorporated  by  reference  into Part II and filed as Exhibit 13 hereto. Portions of the Proxy Statement are incorporated by reference herein into Part III.      PART I  Item 1.  BUSINESS               Hershey     Foods     Corporation     and     its     subsidiaries     (the Corporation)  are engaged in the manufacture,  distribution and sale of consumer food products. The Corporation produces and distributes a broad line of chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery and grocery products.                The  Corporation  was organized  under the laws of the State of Delaware on October  24,  1927,  as a successor  to a business  founded in 1894 by Milton S. Hershey.               In December 2000, the Corporation completed the purchase of the intense and breath freshener mints and gum businesses of Nabisco,  Inc. The Corporation paid $135.0 million to acquire the  businesses,  including  ICE  BREAKERS  and BREATH SAVERS COOL BLASTS  intense  mints,  BREATH  SAVERS  mints, and ICE BREAKERS,  CAREFREE,  STICK*FREE,  BUBBLE YUM and FRUIT STRIPE gums.  Also  included  in the  purchase  were  manufacturing  machinery  and equipment  and a  gum-manufacturing  plant in Las Piedras,  Puerto  Rico.  These businesses had sales of approximately $270 million in 1999.                The  Corporations  principal  product groups  include:  chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery products sold in the form of bar goods, bagged items and  boxed  items;  and  grocery  products  in the form of  baking  ingredients, chocolate  drink mixes,  peanut  butter,  dessert  toppings and  beverages.  The Corporation  believes it is a leader in these product  groups in North  America. Operating profit margins vary considerably among individual products and brands. Generally,  such margins on chocolate and non-chocolate  confectionery  products are greater than those on grocery products.                In North America, the Corporation  manufactures chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery  products  in a variety of packaged  forms and markets  them under more than 50 brands. The different  packaged forms include various  arrangements of the same bar products, such as boxes, trays and bags, as well as a variety of different  sizes  and  weights  of the same bar  products,  such as snack  size, standard,  king size,  large and giant bars.  Among the principal  chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery products in the United States are: HERSHEY'S BITES candies,  HERSHEY'S  classic  caramels,  HERSHEY'S COOKIES   'N' CREME  chocolate  bars,   HERSHEY'S HUGS chocolates, HERSHEY'S KISSES chocolates,  HERSHEY'S KISSES WITH ALMONDS chocolates,  HERSHEY'S  milk chocolate bars, HERSHEY'S  milk  chocolate  bars  with  almonds,   HERSHEY'S MINIATURES   chocolate  bars,   HERSHEY'S   NUGGETS  chocolates, AMAZIN' FRUIT gummy bears fruit candy, CARAMELLO candy bars, GOOD &  PLENTY candy,  HEATH toffee bar, JOLLY  RANCHER candy,  KIT  KAT wafer bars,  LUDEN'S  throat drops,  MILK DUDS chocolate covered caramels, MR. GOODBAR milk chocolate bars with peanuts,  PAYDAY  peanut caramel  bar, PETER PAUL ALMOND JOY candy bars,  PETER PAUL MOUNDS candy bars, POT OF GOLD boxed chocolates, RAIN-BLO  and SUPER  BUBBLE  gum,  REESE'S  NUTRAGEOUS candy bars,  REESE'S  peanut butter cups, REESE'S PIECES candies,   REESESTICKS   wafer   bars,   ROLO   caramels  in  milk chocolate, SIXLETS candies, SKOR toffee bars, SYMPHONY milk chocolate bars,  SWEET  ESCAPES  candy bars,  TASTETATIONS  candy, TWIZZLERS  candy,   WHATCHAMACALLIT  candy  bars,  WHOPPERS malted milk balls, YORK  peppermint pattie candy, 5TH AVENUE candy bars  and  ZERO  candy  bars.   Principal   products  in  Canada  include CHIPITS  chocolate  chips,  GLOSETTE   chocolate-covered  raisins, peanuts and  almonds,  OH  HENRY!  candy bars,  POT OF GOLD  boxed chocolates,  REESE PEANUT BUTTER CUPS candy, and TWIZZLERS  candy. The  Corporation  also  manufactures,  imports,  markets,  sells and distributes chocolate  products  in  Mexico  under  the  HERSHEY'S  brand  name.                The Corporation  manufactures  and/or markets a line of grocery products in the baking, beverage, peanut butter and toppings categories.  Principal products in the United States include  HERSHEY'S,  REESE'S and HEATH baking pieces,  HERSHEY'S  drink  boxes,  HERSHEY'S  chocolate  milk mix, HERSHEY'S   cocoa,   HERSHEY'S   CHOCOLATE   SHOPPE  ice  cream toppings,   HERSHEY'S   HOT   COCOA   COLLECTION   hot   cocoa   mix, HERSHEY'S   syrup  and  REESE'S  peanut   butter.   HERSHEY'S chocolate and strawberry  flavored milks are produced and sold under license by various dairies  throughout the United States,  using milk mixes manufactured by the  Corporation.  Baking and various  other  products  are produced and sold under the  HERSHEY'S  and REESE'S brand names by third parties who have  been  granted  licenses  by  the  Corporation  to  use  these  trademarks.  1                 The Corporations  products are sold primarily to grocery wholesalers, chain grocery stores, candy distributors, mass merchandisers, chain drug stores, vending companies, wholesale clubs, convenience stores, concessionaires and food distributors  by full-time  sales  representatives,  food brokers and  part-time retail sales merchandisers  throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. The Corporation  believes its products are sold in over 2 million  retail outlets in North America. In 2000, sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Subsidiaries amounted to approximately 17% of the Corporations total net sales.                In Japan, the Philippines,  Korea and China, the Corporation imports and/or markets  selected  confectionery  and grocery  products.  The  Corporation  also markets  confectionery  and  grocery  products in over 90  countries  worldwide.                The  Corporations  marketing  strategy is based upon the consistently superior  quality  of its  products,  mass  distribution  and the best  possible consumer  value in terms of price  and  weight.  In  addition,  the  Corporation devotes  considerable  resources to the  identification,  development,  testing, manufacturing and marketing of new products.  The Corporation utilizes a variety of promotional  programs for customers and advertising and promotional  programs for consumers.  The Corporation  employs  promotional  programs at various times during  the  year  to  stimulate  sales  of  certain  products.   Chocolate  and non-chocolate  confectionery and grocery seasonal and holiday-related sales have typically  been  highest  during  the third  and  fourth  quarters  of the year.                The Corporation  recognizes that the mass distribution of its consumer food products is an  important  element in  maintaining  sales  growth and  providing service to its customers.  The Corporation attempts to meet the changing demands of its customers by planning optimum stock levels and reasonable  delivery times consistent with  achievement of efficiencies in  distribution.  To achieve these objectives,  the  Corporation  has  developed a  distribution  network  from its manufacturing  plants,  distribution centers and field warehouses  strategically located throughout the United States,  Canada and Mexico. The Corporation uses a combination  of public and contract  carriers to deliver its  products  from the distribution  points to its customers.  In conjunction  with sales and marketing efforts,  the  distribution  system  has  been  instrumental  in  the  effective promotion of new, as well as established, products on both national and regional scales.                From time to time,  the  Corporation  has changed the prices and weights of its products to accommodate  changes in  manufacturing  costs,  the  competitive environment and profit objectives,  while at the same time maintaining  consumer value.  The last  standard  candy  bar price  increase  was  implemented  by the Corporation  in  December  1995,  resulting  in a  wholesale  price  increase of approximately  11% on its standard and  king-size  candy bars sold in the United States.                The  most   significant   raw  material  used  in  the  production  of  the Corporations chocolate products is cocoa beans. This commodity is imported principally  from  West  African,  South  American  and Far  Eastern  equatorial regions.  West Africa accounts for approximately  70% of the worlds  crop. Cocoa beans are not uniform,  and the various  grades and varieties  reflect the diverse agricultural  practices and natural conditions found in the many growing areas.  The  Corporation  buys a mix of cocoa  beans  to meet its  manufacturing requirements.                The table  below  sets forth  annual  average  cocoa  prices as well as the highest and lowest monthly  averages for each of the calendar  years  indicated. The prices are the monthly average of the quotations at noon of the three active futures  trading  contracts  closest to maturity on the New York Board of Trade. Because of the Corporations  forward purchasing practices discussed below, and premium  prices paid for certain  varieties  of cocoa beans,  these  average futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of the Corporations average cost of cocoa beans or cocoa products.    Cocoa Futures Contract Prices  (cents per pound)             Source:  International Cocoa Organization Quarterly Bulletin of Cocoa Statistics                   The Federal  Agricultural  and Improvement  Reform Act of 1996,  which is a seven-year farm bill,  impacts the prices of sugar,  peanuts and milk because it sets price support levels for these commodities. 2                 The price of sugar, the Corporation's  second most important  commodity for its domestic chocolate and confectionery  products, is subject to price supports under the above  referenced  farm  legislation.  Due to import quotas and duties imposed to support the price of sugar  established  by that  legislation,  sugar prices  paid by United  States  users are  currently  substantially  higher than prices on the world sugar market.  The average  wholesale  list price of refined sugar, F.O.B.  Northeast,  has remained in a range of 25¢  to 32¢  per pound for the past ten years.  Peanut and almond  prices  remained  near  normal levels throughout 2000. Milk prices moderated in 2000 as a result of strong milk production.  The  Corporation  believes  that the  supply  of raw  materials  is adequate to meet its manufacturing requirements.               The  Corporation  attempts  to  minimize  the effect of price  fluctuations related to the purchase of its major raw materials primarily through the forward purchasing  of such  commodities  to  cover  future  manufacturing  requirements generally for periods ranging from 3 to 24 months.  With regard to cocoa, sugar, corn  sweeteners,  natural gas and certain dairy products,  price risks are also managed by entering into futures contracts.  At the present time, active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing the Corporation's other major raw materials.  Futures contracts are used in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa,   sugar,   corn  sweeteners,   natural  gas  and  certain  dairy  product requirements  principally to take advantage of market fluctuations which provide more favorable pricing opportunities and to increase diversity or flexibility in sourcing these raw materials.  The Corporation's commodity procurement practices are  intended  to  reduce  the  risk of  future  price  increases,  but also may potentially  limit the  Corporation's  ability to benefit  from  possible  price decreases.               The primary effect on liquidity from using futures  contracts is associated with margin  requirements for futures  contracts  related to cocoa,  sugar, corn sweeteners,  natural gas and certain dairy  products.  Cash outflows and inflows result from original  margins  which are "good faith  deposits"  established  by futures exchanges to ensure that market participants will meet their contractual financial obligations.  Additionally, variation margin payments and receipts are required  when the value of open  positions  is adjusted to reflect  daily price movements.  The  magnitude of such cash  inflows and outflows is dependent  upon price  coverage  levels and the  volatility of the markets.  Historically,  cash flows related to margin requirements have not been material to the Corporation's total working capital requirements.               The  Corporation  manages the purchase of forward and futures  contracts by developing  and  monitoring   procurement  strategies  for  each  of  its  major commodities.  These  procurement  strategies,   including  the  use  of  futures contracts to hedge the pricing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas and certain  dairy  products,  are  directly  linked  to the  overall  planning  and management  of the  Corporation's  business,  since  the  cost of raw  materials accounts for a significant  portion of the cost of finished  goods.  Procurement strategies with regard to cocoa, sugar and other major raw material requirements are  developed  by the  analysis  of  fundamentals,  including  weather and crop analysis,  and  by  discussions  with  market  analysts,  brokers  and  dealers. Procurement  strategies are  determined,  implemented and monitored on a regular basis by senior management. Procurement activities for all major commodities are also reported to the Board of Directors on a regular basis.               The   Corporation  has  license   agreements  with  several   companies  to manufacture  and/or sell  products  worldwide.  Among the more  significant  are agreements with affiliated  companies of Cadbury Schweppes p.l.c. to manufacture and/or  market and  distribute  YORK,  PETER  PAUL ALMOND  JOY and PETER  PAUL   MOUNDS   confectionery   products   worldwide  as  well  as CADBURY and CARAMELLO confectionery products in the United States. The  Corporation's  rights under these  agreements are extendible on a long-term basis  at  the  Corporation's   option.   The  license  for  CADBURY  and CARAMELLO  products is subject to a minimum sales  requirement  which the Corporation exceeded in 2000. The Corporation also has an agreement with Societe des  Produits  Nestle SA, which  licenses the  Corporation  to  manufacture  and distribute KIT KAT and ROLO  confectionery  products in the United States.  The  Corporation's  rights under this  agreement  are  extendible  on a long-term  basis at the  Corporation's  option,  subject to certain  conditions, including  minimum unit volume sales.  In 2000, the minimum volume  requirements were  exceeded.   The   Corporation  has  an  agreement  with  an  affiliate  of Huhtamäki  Oy (Huhtamaki)  pursuant to which it licenses the use of certain trademarks,   including  GOOD  &   PLENTY,   HEATH,   JOLLY RANCHER,  MILK DUDS,  PAYDAY and WHOPPERS confectionery products worldwide. The Corporation's rights under this agreement are extendible on a long-term basis at the Corporation's option.  Competition               Many of the  Corporation's  brands enjoy wide consumer  acceptance  and are among the leading brands sold in the marketplace. However, these brands are sold in  highly  competitive  markets  and  compete  with many  other  multinational, national,  regional and local firms,  some of which have  resources in excess of those available to the Corporation. 3   Trademarks               The Corporation  owns various  registered and  unregistered  trademarks and service marks, and has rights under licenses to use various trademarks which are of material importance to the Corporation's business.  Backlog of Orders               The Corporation  manufactures primarily for stock and fills customer orders from  finished  goods  inventories.  While at any given  time  there may be some backlog  of orders,  such  backlog is not  material  in respect to total  annual sales, nor are the changes from time to time  significant,  aside from the third quarter of 1999 when a  significant  backlog of orders  resulted  from  customer service and order fulfillment  problems  encountered  during the start-up of new business systems and processes.  Research and Development               The  Corporation  engages  in  a  variety  of  research  activities.  These principally involve  development of new products,  improvement in the quality of existing products,  improvement and modernization of production  processes,  and the development and  implementation  of new  technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed product lines. Information concerning the Corporation's  research  and  development  expense is contained in Note 1 of the Corporation's Annual Report to Stockholders  included as Appendix A to the Proxy Statement,  which  information is incorporated  herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 13 hereto.  Regulation               The Corporation's domestic plants are subject to inspection by the Food and Drug  Administration and various other governmental  agencies,  and its products must comply with  regulations  under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and with  various  comparable  state  statutes   regulating  the  manufacturing  and marketing of food products.  Environmental Considerations               In the past the Corporation has made  investments  based on compliance with environmental  laws and regulations.  Such  expenditures  have not been material with respect to the Corporation's capital expenditures,  earnings or competitive position.  Employees               As of December 31, 2000, the Corporation had approximately 14,300 full-time and 1,400  part-time  employees,  of whom  approximately  6,300 were  covered by collective  bargaining  agreements.   The  Corporation  considers  its  employee relations to be good.  Financial Information by Geographic Area               Information  concerning the Corporation's  geographic segments is contained in Note 15 of the  Corporation's  Annual Report to Stockholders  included as Appendix A to the Proxy Statement,  which information is incorporated  herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 13 hereto.  Safe Harbor Statement               The nature of the Corporation's  operations and the environment in which it operates  subject  it  to  changing   economic,   competitive,   regulatory  and technological conditions, risks and uncertainties.  In connection with the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Corporation notes the following factors which, among others,  could cause future results to differ materially from the forward-looking  statements,  expectations and  assumptions  expressed  or  implied  herein.  Many  of the  forward-looking statements  contained  in  this  document  may  be  identified  by  the  use  of forward-looking  words  such as  "believe,"  "expect,"  "anticipate,"  "should," "planned," "estimated," and "potential," among others. Factors which could cause results to differ include,  but are not limited to: changes in the confectionery and grocery business  environment,  including actions of competitors and changes in consumer preferences; changes in governmental laws and regulations, including income  taxes;  market  demand  for new and  existing  products;  changes in raw material costs; and the Corporation's  ability to implement  improvements to and reduce costs associated with the Corporation's customer service, warehousing and order fulfillment processes and systems. 4   Item 2.    PROPERTIES               The  following  is a list  of  the  Corporation's  principal  manufacturing properties. The Corporation owns each of these properties.                UNITED STATES                  Hershey, Pennsylvania - confectionery and grocery products              (3 principal plants)                 Lancaster, Pennsylvania - confectionery products                 Oakdale, California - confectionery and grocery products                          Robinson, Illinois - confectionery and grocery products                 Stuarts Draft, Virginia - confectionery and grocery products                            CANADA                  Smiths Falls, Ontario - confectionery and grocery products                           In addition to the  locations  indicated  above,  the  Corporation  owns or leases  several  other   properties   used  for   manufacturing   chocolate  and non-chocolate confectionery and grocery products and for sales, distribution and administrative functions.                The  Corporation's  plants are efficient and well maintained.  These plants generally have adequate capacity and can accommodate seasonal demands,  changing product mixes and certain  additional  growth. The largest plants are located in Hershey,  Pennsylvania.  Many additions and improvements have been made to these facilities  over the  years and the  plants'  manufacturing  equipment  includes equipment of the latest type and technology.  Item 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS               In January 1999, the Corporation  received a Notice of Proposed  Deficiency (Notice)  from the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  related to the years 1989 through 1996. The Notice  pertained to the Corporate Owned Life Insurance (COLI) program which was implemented by the Corporation in 1989. The IRS disallowed the interest  expense  deductions  associated  with the  underlying  life  insurance policies. The total deficiency of $61.2 million, including interest, was paid to the IRS in  September  2000 to  eliminate  further  accruing  of  interest.  The Corporation  may be subject to  additional  assessments  for  federal  taxes and interest  for years  1997 and 1998 and for state  taxes  and  interest  for 1989 through 1998. The  Corporation  believes that it has fully complied with the tax law as it relates to its COLI program,  has filed for the refund of amounts paid and will continue to seek favorable  resolution of this matter.  The Corporation has no other material  pending legal  proceedings,  other than ordinary  routine litigation incidental to its business.  Item 4.
