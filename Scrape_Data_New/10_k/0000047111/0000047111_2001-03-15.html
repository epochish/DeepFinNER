Item 1.  BUSINESS</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Hershey     Foods     Corporation     and     its     subsidiaries     (the
&#147;Corporation&#148;)  are engaged in the manufacture,  distribution and sale
of consumer food products. The Corporation produces and distributes a broad line
of chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery and grocery products. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The  Corporation  was organized  under the laws of the State of Delaware on
October  24,  1927,  as a successor  to a business  founded in 1894 by Milton S.
Hershey.</font></P>

<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     In December 2000, the Corporation completed the purchase of the intense and
breath freshener mints and gum businesses of Nabisco,  Inc. The Corporation paid
$135.0 million to acquire the  businesses,  including  <I>ICE  BREAKERS</I>  and
<I>BREATH SAVERS COOL BLASTS  </I>intense  mints,  <I>BREATH  SAVERS</I>  mints,
and<I> ICE BREAKERS,  CAREFREE,  STICK*FREE,  BUBBLE YUM</I> and <I>FRUIT STRIPE
</I>gums.  Also  included  in the  purchase  were  manufacturing  machinery  and
equipment  and a  gum-manufacturing  plant in Las Piedras,  Puerto  Rico.  These
businesses had sales of approximately $270 million in 1999. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The  Corporation&#146;s  principal  product groups  include:  chocolate and
non-chocolate confectionery products sold in the form of bar goods, bagged items
and  boxed  items;  and  grocery  products  in the form of  baking  ingredients,
chocolate  drink mixes,  peanut  butter,  dessert  toppings and  beverages.  The
Corporation  believes it is a leader in these product  groups in North  America.
Operating profit margins vary considerably among individual products and brands.
Generally,  such margins on chocolate and non-chocolate  confectionery  products
are greater than those on grocery products. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     In North America, the Corporation  manufactures chocolate and non-chocolate
confectionery  products  in a variety of packaged  forms and markets  them under
more than 50 brands. The different  packaged forms include various  arrangements

<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The Corporation&#146;s  products are sold primarily to grocery wholesalers,
chain grocery stores, candy distributors, mass merchandisers, chain drug stores,
vending companies, wholesale clubs, convenience stores, concessionaires and food
distributors  by full-time  sales  representatives,  food brokers and  part-time
retail sales merchandisers  throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. The
Corporation  believes its products are sold in over 2 million  retail outlets in
North America. In 2000, sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Subsidiaries amounted
to approximately 17% of the Corporation&#146;s total net sales. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     In Japan, the Philippines,  Korea and China, the Corporation imports and/or
markets  selected  confectionery  and grocery  products.  The  Corporation  also
markets  confectionery  and  grocery  products in over 90  countries  worldwide.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The  Corporation&#146;s  marketing  strategy is based upon the consistently
superior  quality  of its  products,  mass  distribution  and the best  possible
consumer  value in terms of price  and  weight.  In  addition,  the  Corporation
devotes  considerable  resources to the  identification,  development,  testing,
manufacturing and marketing of new products.  The Corporation utilizes a variety
of promotional  programs for customers and advertising and promotional  programs
for consumers.  The Corporation  employs  promotional  programs at various times
during  the  year  to  stimulate  sales  of  certain  products.   Chocolate  and
non-chocolate  confectionery and grocery seasonal and holiday-related sales have
typically  been  highest  during  the third  and  fourth  quarters  of the year.
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The Corporation  recognizes that the mass distribution of its consumer food
products is an  important  element in  maintaining  sales  growth and  providing
service to its customers.  The Corporation attempts to meet the changing demands
of its customers by planning optimum stock levels and reasonable  delivery times
consistent with  achievement of efficiencies in  distribution.  To achieve these
objectives,  the  Corporation  has  developed a  distribution  network  from its
manufacturing  plants,  distribution centers and field warehouses  strategically
located throughout the United States,  Canada and Mexico. The Corporation uses a
combination  of public and contract  carriers to deliver its  products  from the
distribution  points to its customers.  In conjunction  with sales and marketing
efforts,  the  distribution  system  has  been  instrumental  in  the  effective
promotion of new, as well as established, products on both national and regional
scales. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     From time to time,  the  Corporation  has changed the prices and weights of
its products to accommodate  changes in  manufacturing  costs,  the  competitive
environment and profit objectives,  while at the same time maintaining  consumer
value.  The last  standard  candy  bar price  increase  was  implemented  by the
Corporation  in  December  1995,  resulting  in a  wholesale  price  increase of
approximately  11% on its standard and  king-size  candy bars sold in the United
States. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The  most   significant   raw  material  used  in  the  production  of  the
Corporation&#146;s chocolate products is cocoa beans. This commodity is imported
principally  from  West  African,  South  American  and Far  Eastern  equatorial
regions.  West Africa accounts for approximately  70% of the world&#146;s  crop.
Cocoa beans are not uniform,  and the various  grades and varieties  reflect the
diverse agricultural  practices and natural conditions found in the many growing
areas.  The  Corporation  buys a mix of cocoa  beans  to meet its  manufacturing
requirements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The table  below  sets forth  annual  average  cocoa  prices as well as the
highest and lowest monthly  averages for each of the calendar  years  indicated.
The prices are the monthly average of the quotations at noon of the three active
futures  trading  contracts  closest to maturity on the New York Board of Trade.
Because of the Corporation&#146;s  forward purchasing practices discussed below,
and premium  prices paid for certain  varieties  of cocoa beans,  these  average
futures contract prices are not necessarily indicative of the Corporation&#146;s
average cost of cocoa beans or cocoa products. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Federal  Agricultural  and Improvement  Reform Act of 1996,  which is a
seven-year farm bill,  impacts the prices of sugar,  peanuts and milk because it
sets price support levels for these commodities.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF" SIZE=2>2 </FONT></P>
<HR SIZE=5 noshade>


<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The price of sugar, the Corporation's  second most important  commodity for
its domestic chocolate and confectionery  products, is subject to price supports
under the above  referenced  farm  legislation.  Due to import quotas and duties
imposed to support the price of sugar  established  by that  legislation,  sugar
prices  paid by United  States  users are  currently  substantially  higher than
prices on the world sugar market.  The average  wholesale  list price of refined
sugar, F.O.B.  Northeast,  has remained in a range of 25&cent;  to 32&cent;  per
pound for the past ten years.  Peanut and almond  prices  remained  near  normal
levels throughout 2000. Milk prices moderated in 2000 as a result of strong milk
production.  The  Corporation  believes  that the  supply  of raw  materials  is
adequate to meet its manufacturing requirements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The  Corporation  attempts  to  minimize  the effect of price  fluctuations
related to the purchase of its major raw materials primarily through the forward
purchasing  of such  commodities  to  cover  future  manufacturing  requirements
generally for periods ranging from 3 to 24 months.  With regard to cocoa, sugar,
corn  sweeteners,  natural gas and certain dairy products,  price risks are also
managed by entering into futures contracts.  At the present time, active futures
contracts are not available for use in pricing the Corporation's other major raw
materials.  Futures contracts are used in combination with forward purchasing of
cocoa,   sugar,   corn  sweeteners,   natural  gas  and  certain  dairy  product
requirements  principally to take advantage of market fluctuations which provide
more favorable pricing opportunities and to increase diversity or flexibility in
sourcing these raw materials.  The Corporation's commodity procurement practices
are  intended  to  reduce  the  risk of  future  price  increases,  but also may
potentially  limit the  Corporation's  ability to benefit  from  possible  price
decreases.</font></p>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The primary effect on liquidity from using futures  contracts is associated
with margin  requirements for futures  contracts  related to cocoa,  sugar, corn
sweeteners,  natural gas and certain dairy  products.  Cash outflows and inflows
result from original  margins  which are "good faith  deposits"  established  by
futures exchanges to ensure that market participants will meet their contractual
financial obligations.  Additionally, variation margin payments and receipts are
required  when the value of open  positions  is adjusted to reflect  daily price
movements.  The  magnitude of such cash  inflows and outflows is dependent  upon
price  coverage  levels and the  volatility of the markets.  Historically,  cash
flows related to margin requirements have not been material to the Corporation's
total working capital requirements.</FONT></P>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The  Corporation  manages the purchase of forward and futures  contracts by
developing  and  monitoring   procurement  strategies  for  each  of  its  major
commodities.  These  procurement  strategies,   including  the  use  of  futures
contracts to hedge the pricing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas and
certain  dairy  products,  are  directly  linked  to the  overall  planning  and
management  of the  Corporation's  business,  since  the  cost of raw  materials
accounts for a significant  portion of the cost of finished  goods.  Procurement
strategies with regard to cocoa, sugar and other major raw material requirements
are  developed  by the  analysis  of  fundamentals,  including  weather and crop
analysis,  and  by  discussions  with  market  analysts,  brokers  and  dealers.
Procurement  strategies are  determined,  implemented and monitored on a regular
basis by senior management. Procurement activities for all major commodities are
also reported to the Board of Directors on a regular basis.</FONT></P>

sales, nor are the changes from time to time  significant,  aside from the third
quarter of 1999 when a  significant  backlog of orders  resulted  from  customer
service and order fulfillment  problems  encountered  during the start-up of new

Item 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</B></font>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     In January 1999, the Corporation  received a Notice of Proposed  Deficiency
(Notice)  from the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  related to the years 1989
through 1996. The Notice  pertained to the Corporate Owned Life Insurance (COLI)
program which was implemented by the Corporation in 1989. The IRS disallowed the
interest  expense  deductions  associated  with the  underlying  life  insurance
policies. The total deficiency of $61.2 million, including interest, was paid to
the IRS in  September  2000 to  eliminate  further  accruing  of  interest.  The
Corporation  may be subject to  additional  assessments  for  federal  taxes and
interest  for years  1997 and 1998 and for state  taxes  and  interest  for 1989
through 1998. The  Corporation  believes that it has fully complied with the tax
law as it relates to its COLI program,  has filed for the refund of amounts paid
and will continue to seek favorable  resolution of this matter.  The Corporation
has no other material  pending legal  proceedings,  other than ordinary  routine
litigation incidental to its business.</FONT>

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS</B>
<P align="left">
To Hershey Foods Corporation:
<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     We have audited,  in accordance with auditing standards  generally accepted
in the United States, the consolidated  financial statements included in Hershey
Foods  Corporation's Proxy Statement for its 2001 Annual Meeting of Stockholders
incorporated  by reference in this Form 10-K, and have issued our report thereon
dated January 26, 2001. Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion
on those financial  statements  taken as a whole. The schedule listed on page 15
in Item 14(a)(2) is the  responsibility of the  Corporation's  management and is
presented  for  purposes  of  complying   with  the   Securities   and  Exchange
Commission's  rules  and is not part of the  basic  financial  statements.  This
schedule has been subjected to the auditing  procedures  applied in the audit of
the  basic  financial  statements  and,  in our  opinion,  fairly  states in all
material  respects  the  financial  data  required  to be set forth  therein  in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
