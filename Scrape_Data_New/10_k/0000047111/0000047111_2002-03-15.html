<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     Hershey     Foods     Corporation     and     its     subsidiaries     (the
&#147;Corporation&#148;)  are engaged in the manufacture,  distribution and sale
of consumer food products. The Corporation produces and distributes a broad line
of chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery and grocery products. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The  Corporation  was organized  under the laws of the State of Delaware on
October  24,  1927,  as a successor  to a business  founded in 1894 by Milton S.
Hershey.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     In July  2001,  the  Corporation&#146;s  Brazilian  subsidiary,  Hershey do
Brasil,  acquired the chocolate and confectionery  business of Visagis for $17.1
million.  Included in the acquisition  were the  <I>IO-IO</I>  brand of hazelnut
cr&#232;me  items and the  chocolate and  confectionery  products sold under the
<I>VISCONTI</I>  brand. Also included in the purchase were a manufacturing plant
and  confectionery  equipment in Sao Roque,  Brazil.  This business had sales of
approximately $20 million in 2000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     In   September   2001,   the   Corporation   completed   the  sale  of  its
<I>LUDEN&#146;S</I>  throat drops business to Pharmacia Consumer  Healthcare,  a
unit of  Pharmacia  Corporation.  Included in the sale were the  trademarks  and
manufacturing equipment for the throat drops business.  Under a supply agreement
with Pharmacia, the Corporation agreed to manufacture <I>LUDEN&#146;S</I> throat
drops for up to 19  months  after the date of sale.  Under a  separate  services
agreement,  the Corporation agreed to continue to sell, warehouse and distribute
<I>LUDEN&#146;S</I> throat drops through March 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     In October  2001,  the  Corporation  announced  initiatives  to enhance its
future  operating  performance  by focusing on profitable  sales  growth,
ongoing   improvement  of  margins  and  asset   management  and  a  more
streamlined,  results-driven organization. A charge to cost of sales, along with
a business   realignment  and  asset  impairment   charge,   totaling   $278.4
million  before  tax, or $1.25 per share - diluted,  were recorded in
the fourth  quarter of 2001 to support the  initiatives.  Additional  charges of
approximately  $31.6  million before tax, or $.14 per share &#150;
diluted,  are expected to be recorded in 2002.  These  initiatives will generate
ongoing  annual  savings of $75 million to $80 million  when fully  implemented,
which will be reinvested to enhance  marketing  and selling  capabilities.  Cash
flows  for the  business  have  increased  as a  result  of  these  initiatives.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The charge to cost of sales primarily included costs related to selling
and  reducing  raw material  inventories,  principally  cocoa beans and cocoa
butter,  no longer required to support operations.  The business realignment
and  asset  impairments   charge  included  costs  related  to  outsourcing  the
production of cocoa powder, the elimination of certain non-strategic brands, the
elimination of underutilized capacity through the closure of three manufacturing
facilities and one distribution  center,  realignment of the sales organization,
and a voluntary work force reduction program. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     The  Corporation&#146;s  principal  product groups  include:  chocolate and
non-chocolate confectionery products sold in the form of bar goods, bagged items
and  boxed  items;  and  grocery  products  in the form of  baking  ingredients,
chocolate  drink mixes,  peanut  butter,  dessert  toppings and  beverages.  The
Corporation  believes it is a leader in these product  groups in North  America.
Operating profit margins vary considerably among individual products and brands.
Generally,  such margins on chocolate and non-chocolate  confectionery  products
are greater than those on grocery products. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     In North America, the Corporation  manufactures chocolate and non-chocolate
confectionery  products  in a variety of packaged  forms and markets  them under
more than 50 brands. The different  packaged forms include various  arrangements
of the same bar products, such as boxes, trays and bags, as well as a variety of
different  sizes  and  weights  of the same bar  products,  such as snack  size,
standard,  king size,  large and giant bars.  Among the principal  chocolate and
non-chocolate confectionery products in the United States are: <I>HERSHEY&#146;S

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Corporation manufactures and/or markets a line of grocery products in the
baking, beverage, peanut butter and toppings categories. Principal products in
the United States include <I>HERSHEY&#146;S, REESE&#146;S</I> and<I> HEATH</I>

using milk mixes manufactured by the Corporation. Baking and various other
products are produced and sold under the <I>HERSHEY&#146;S</I> and
<I>REESE&#146;S</I> brand names by third parties who have been granted licenses
by the Corporation to use these trademarks. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Corporation has license agreements with several companies to manufacture and/or
sell products worldwide. Among the more significant are agreements with
affiliated companies of Cadbury Schweppes p.l.c. to manufacture and/or market
and distribute <I>YORK,</I> <I>PETER PAUL ALMOND JOY </I>and <I>PETER PAUL
MOUNDS </I>confectionery products worldwide as well as <I>CADBURY </I>and
<I>CARAMELLO </I>confectionery products in the United States. The
Corporation&#146;s rights under these agreements are extendible on a long-term
basis at the Corporation&#146;s option. The license for <I>CADBURY </I>and
<I>CARAMELLO </I>products is subject to a minimum sales requirement which the
Corporation exceeded in 2001. The Corporation also has an agreement with Societe
des Produits Nestle SA, which licenses the Corporation to manufacture and
distribute <I>KIT KAT </I>and <I>ROLO </I>confectionery products in the United
States. The Corporation&#146;s rights under this agreement are extendible on a
long-term basis at the Corporation&#146;s option, subject to certain conditions,
including minimum unit volume sales. In 2001, the minimum volume requirements
were exceeded. The Corporation has an agreement with an affiliate of
Huhtam&#228;ki Oy (&#147;Huhtamaki&#148;) pursuant to which it licenses the use
of certain trademarks, including <I>GOOD &amp; PLENTY, HEATH, JOLLY RANCHER,
MILK DUDS, PAYDAY </I>and <I>WHOPPERS</I> confectionery products worldwide. The
Corporation&#146;s rights under this agreement are extendible on a long-term
basis at the Corporation&#146;s option. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Corporation&#146;s products are sold primarily to grocery wholesalers, chain
grocery stores, candy distributors, mass merchandisers, chain drug stores,
vending companies, wholesale clubs, convenience stores, concessionaires and food
distributors by full-time sales representatives, food brokers and part-time
retail sales merchandisers throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. The
Corporation believes its products are sold in over 2 million retail outlets in
North America. In 2001, sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries amounted
to approximately 18% of the Corporation&#146;s total net sales. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
Argentina, Brazil, China, Japan, Korea, and the Philippines, the Corporation
imports and/or markets selected confectionery and grocery products. The
Corporation also markets confectionery and grocery products in over 90 countries
worldwide. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Corporation&#146;s marketing strategy is based upon the consistently superior
quality of its products, mass distribution and the best possible consumer value
in terms of price and weight. In addition, the Corporation devotes considerable
resources to the identification, development, testing, manufacturing and
marketing of new products. The Corporation utilizes a variety of promotional
programs for customers and advertising and promotional programs for consumers.
The Corporation employs promotional programs at various times during the year to
stimulate sales of certain products. Chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery
and grocery seasonal and holiday-related sales have typically been highest
during the third and fourth quarters of the year. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Corporation recognizes that the mass distribution of its consumer food products
is an important element in maintaining sales growth and providing service to its
customers. The Corporation attempts to meet the changing demands of its
customers by planning optimum stock levels and reasonable delivery times
consistent with achievement of efficiencies in distribution. To achieve these
objectives, the Corporation has developed a distribution network from its
manufacturing plants, distribution centers and field warehouses strategically
located throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. The Corporation uses a
combination of public and contract carriers to deliver its products from the
distribution points to its customers. In conjunction with sales and marketing
efforts, the distribution system has been instrumental in the effective
promotion of new, as well as established, products on both national and regional
scales. </FONT></P>

<HR SIZE=2 NOSHADE>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From
time to time, the Corporation has changed the prices and weights of its products
to accommodate changes in manufacturing costs, the competitive environment and
profit objectives, while at the same time maintaining consumer value. The last
standard candy bar price increase was implemented by the Corporation in December
1995, resulting in a wholesale price increase of approximately 11% on its
standard and king-size candy bars sold in the United States. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
most significant raw material used in the production of the Corporation&#146;s
chocolate products is cocoa beans. This commodity is imported principally from
West African, South American and Far Eastern equatorial regions. West Africa
accounts for approximately 70% of the world&#146;s crop. Cocoa beans are not
uniform, and the various grades and varieties reflect the diverse agricultural
practices and natural conditions found in the many growing areas. The
Corporation buys a mix of cocoa beans to meet its manufacturing requirements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
table below sets forth annual average cocoa prices as well as the highest and
lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated. The prices are
the monthly average of the quotations at noon of the three active futures
trading contracts closest to maturity on the New York Board of Trade. Because of
the Corporation&#146;s forward purchasing practices discussed below, and premium
prices paid for certain varieties of cocoa beans, these average futures contract
prices are not necessarily indicative of the Corporation&#146;s average cost of
cocoa beans or cocoa products. </FONT></P>

The  Federal  Agricultural  and  Improvement  Reform  Act of  1996,  which  is a
seven-year farm bill,  impacts the prices of sugar,  peanuts and milk because it
sets price support levels for these commodities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The price of sugar, the  Corporation&#146;s  second most important commodity for
its domestic chocolate and confectionery  products, is subject to price supports
under the above  referenced  farm  legislation.  Due to import quotas and duties
imposed to support the price of sugar  established  by that  legislation,  sugar
prices  paid by United  States  users are  currently  substantially  higher than
prices on the world sugar market.  The average  wholesale  list price of refined
sugar, F.O.B.  Northeast,  has remained in a range of 25&#162;  to 32&#162;  per
pound for the past ten years.  Peanut and almond  prices  remained  near  normal
levels  throughout  2001. Milk prices increased in 2001 as a result of declining
milk  production.  The Corporation  believes that the supply of raw materials is
adequate to meet its manufacturing requirements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The  Corporation  attempts to minimize the effect of future  price  fluctuations
related to the purchase of its major raw  materials  primarily  through  forward
purchasing  to cover future  manufacturing  requirements,  generally for periods
from 3 to 24 months. With regard to cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners,  natural gas,
fuel oil and certain  dairy  products,  price risks are also managed by entering
into futures  contracts.  At the present time,  active futures contracts are not
available  for use in pricing the  Corporation&#146;s  other major raw  material
requirements.  Futures contracts are used in combination with forward purchasing
of  cocoa,  sugar,  corn  sweetener,  natural  gas  and  certain  dairy  product
requirements  principally to take advantage of market fluctuations which provide
more  favorable  pricing  opportunities  and  flexibility  in sourcing these raw
materials  and  energy  requirements.  Fuel oil  futures  contracts  are used to
minimize   price   fluctuations    associated   with   the    Corporation&#146;s
transportation costs. The Corporation&#146;s commodity procurement practices are
intended to reduce the risk of future price increases,  but also may potentially
limit the ability to benefit from possible price decreases. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
primary effect on liquidity from using futures contracts is associated with
margin requirements for futures contracts related to cocoa, sugar, corn
sweeteners, natural gas, fuel oil and certain dairy products. Cash outflows and
inflows result from original margins which are &#147;good faith deposits&nbsp;&#148;
established by futures exchanges to ensure that market participants will meet
their contractual financial obligations. Additionally, variation margin payments
and receipts are required when the value of open positions is adjusted to
reflect daily price movements. The magnitude of such cash inflows and outflows
is dependent upon price coverage levels and the volatility of the markets.
Historically, cash flows related to margin requirements have not been material
to the Corporation&#146;s total working capital requirements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Corporation manages the purchase of forward and futures contracts by developing
and monitoring procurement strategies for each of its major commodities. These
procurement strategies, including the use of futures contracts to hedge the
pricing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, transportation costs and
certain dairy products, are directly linked to the overall planning and
management of the Corporation&#146;s business, since the cost of raw materials,
energy and transportation accounts for a significant portion of cost of sales.
Procurement strategies with regard to cocoa, sugar and other major raw material
requirements, energy requirements, and transportation costs are developed by the
analysis of fundamentals, including weather and crop analysis, and by
discussions with market analysts, brokers and dealers. Procurement strategies
are determined, implemented and monitored on a regular basis by senior
management. Procurement activities for all major commodities are also reported
to the Board of Directors on a regular basis. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many
of the Corporation&#146;s brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among
the leading brands sold in the marketplace. However, these brands are sold in
highly competitive markets and compete with many other multinational, national,
regional and local firms, some of which have resources in excess of those
available to the Corporation. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Trademarks</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

Orders</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Corporation manufactures primarily for stock and fills customer orders from
finished goods inventories. While at any given time there may be some backlog of
orders, such backlog is not material in respect to total annual sales, nor are
the changes from time to time significant, aside from the third quarter of 1999
when a significant backlog of orders resulted from customer service and order
fulfillment problems encountered during the start-up of new business systems and
processes. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Research and
Development</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Corporation engages in a variety of research activities. These principally
involve development of new products, improvement in the quality of existing
products, improvement and modernization of production processes, and the
development and implementation of new technologies to enhance the quality and
value of both current and proposed product lines. Information concerning the
Corporation&#146;s research and development expense is contained in Note 1 of
the Corporation&#146;s Annual Report to Stockholders included as Appendix A to
the Proxy Statement, which information is incorporated herein by reference and
filed as Exhibit 13 hereto. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Corporation&#146;s domestic plants are subject to inspection by the Food and
Drug Administration and various other governmental agencies, and its products
must comply with regulations under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and
with various comparable state statutes regulating the manufacturing and
marketing of food products. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Environmental
Considerations</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the past the Corporation has made investments based on compliance with
environmental laws and regulations. Such expenditures have not been material
with respect to the Corporation&#146;s capital expenditures, earnings or
competitive position. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Employees</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As of December 31, 2001, the Corporation had approximately  14,400 full-time and
1,600  part-time  employees,   of  whom  approximately  6,000  were  covered  by
collective bargaining  agreements.  In 2002, the Corporation expects a reduction
of approximately  600 full-time  employees as a result of a voluntary work force
reduction program. The Corporation  considers its employee relations to be good.
It should be noted that a collective bargaining agreement covering approximately
3,000  employees  at two of  the  Corporation's  principal  plants  in  Hershey,
Pennsylvania expired in November 2001. On February 27, 2002, the employees voted
not to ratify a new  contract  offer,  despite  recommendations  by their  union
negotiating committee and executive board to approve the new five-year contract.
The  Corporation  and the union  negotiating  committee  have agreed to seek the
assistance of a federal mediator. </FONT></P>

Statement</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
nature of the Corporation&#146;s operations and the environment in which it
operates subject it to changing economic, competitive, regulatory and
technological conditions, risks and uncertainties. In connection with the
&#147;safe harbor&#148; provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995, the Corporation notes the following factors which, among others,
could cause future results to differ materially from the forward-looking
statements, expectations and assumptions expressed or implied herein. Many of
the forward-looking statements contained in this document may be identified by
the use of forward-looking words such as &#147;believe,&#148;

&#147;planned,&#148; &#147;estimated,&#148; and &#147;potential,&#148; among
others. Factors which could cause results to differ include, but are not limited
to: changes in the confectionery and grocery business environment, including
actions of competitors and changes in consumer preferences; changes in
governmental laws and regulations, including taxes; market demand for new and
existing products; changes in raw material and other costs; the
Corporation&#146;s ability to implement improvements to and reduce costs
associated with the Corporation&#146;s distribution operations; pension cost
factors, such as actuarial assumptions and employee retirement decisions; and

     <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In January 1999, the Corporation received
a Notice of Proposed Deficiency (Notice) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
related to the years 1989 through  1996.  The Notice  pertained to the Corporate
Owned Life Insurance  (COLI) program which was implemented by the Corporation in
1989. The IRS disallowed the interest  expense  deductions  associated  with the
underlying  life  insurance  policies.  The total  deficiency of $61.2  million,
including  interest,  was paid to the IRS in September 2000 to eliminate further
accruing of interest.  Effective  October 1, 2001, the Corporation  negotiated a
settlement with the IRS regarding the Notice.  The resulting  Closing  Agreement
with the IRS limited the COLI interest expense deductions for all applicable tax
years and resulted in the surrender of all insurance  policies,  thereby  ending
the COLI program.  The  settlement  is a complete  resolution of all federal and
state tax aspects of this program. The Corporation has no other material pending
legal  proceedings,  other than ordinary  routine  litigation  incidental to its
business.</P>

<P align=left>To Hershey Foods Corporation:

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>We have audited, in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, the
consolidated financial statements included in Hershey Foods Corporation&#146;s
Proxy Statement for its 2002 Annual Meeting of Stockholders incorporated by
reference in this Form 10-K, and have issued our report thereon dated January
22, 2002. Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on those
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed on page 15 in Item
14(a)(2) is the responsibility of the Corporation&#146;s management and is
presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#146;s rules and is not part of the basic financial statements. This
schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all
material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole. </FONT></P>
