Item 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;BUSINESS</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Hershey Foods Corporation
and its subsidiaries (the &#147;Corporation&#148;) are engaged in the
manufacture, distribution and sale of confectionery and grocery products. The
Corporation was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 24,
1927, as a successor to a business founded in 1894 by Milton S. Hershey. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In June 2002, the
Corporation completed the sale of a group of the Corporation&#146;s
non-chocolate confectionery candy brands to Farley&#146;s &amp; Sathers Candy
Company, Inc. for $12.0 million in cash as part of its business realignment
initiatives. Included in the transaction were the <I>HEIDE</I>,
<I>JUJYFRUITS</I>, <I>WUNDERBEANS</I> and <I>AMAZIN&#146; FRUIT</I> trademarked
confectionery brands as well as the rights to sell <I>CHUCKLES</I> branded
products, under license. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation&#146;s
principal product groups include: confectionery products sold in the form of bar
goods, bagged items and boxed items; and grocery products in the form of baking
ingredients, chocolate drink mixes, peanut butter, dessert toppings and
beverages. The Corporation believes it is a leader in many of these product
groups in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Operating profit margins vary
considerably among individual products and brands. Generally, such margins on
confectionery products are greater than those on grocery products. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation
manufactures confectionery products in a variety of packaged forms and markets
them under more than 50 brands. The different packaged forms include various
arrangements of the same bar products, such as boxes, trays and bags, as well as
a variety of different sizes and weights of the same bar products, such as snack
size, standard, king size, large and giant bars. Among the principal
confectionery products in the United States are: <I>HERSHEY&#146;S COOKIES
&#145;N&#146; CREME</I> candy bars, <I>HERSHEY&#146;S HUGS</I> chocolates,

bars and <I>ZERO</I> candy bars. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation also
manufactures and/or markets grocery products in the baking, beverage, peanut
butter and toppings categories. Principal products in the United States include
<I>HERSHEY&#146;S, REESE&#146;S</I> and<I> HEATH</I> baking pieces,
<I>HERSHEY&#146;S </I>chocolate milk mix, <I>HERSHEY&#146;S </I>cocoa,

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation has license
agreements with several companies to manufacture and/or sell products worldwide.
Among the more significant are agreements with affiliated companies of Cadbury
Schweppes p.l.c. to manufacture and/or market and distribute <I>YORK,</I>
<I>PETER PAUL ALMOND JOY </I>and <I>PETER PAUL MOUNDS </I>confectionery products

extendible on a long-term basis at the Corporation&#146;s option. The license
for <I>CADBURY </I>and <I>CARAMELLO </I>products is subject to a minimum sales
requirement that the Corporation exceeded in 2002. The Corporation also has an
agreement with Societe des Produits Nestle SA, which licenses the</FONT></P>

<hr size=2 noshade>

<p><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
Corporation  to  manufacture   and   distribute   <I>KIT  KAT  </I>and   <I>ROLO
</I>confectionery  products in the United States. The Corporation&#146;s  rights
under   this   agreement   are   extendible   on  a   long-term   basis  at  the
Corporation&#146;s option, subject to certain conditions, including minimum unit
volume sales.  In 2002,  the minimum  volume  requirements  were  exceeded.  The
Corporation   has  an  agreement   with  an  affiliate  of   Huhtam&#228;ki   Oy
(&#147;Huhtamaki&#148;)  pursuant  to  which  it  licenses  the  use of  certain
trademarks,  including <I>GOOD &amp; PLENTY,  HEATH,  JOLLY RANCHER,  MILK DUDS,
PAYDAY  </I>and  <I>WHOPPERS</I>  for  confectionery  products  worldwide.   The
Corporation&#146;s  rights under this  agreement  are  extendible on a long-term
basis at the Corporation&#146;s option. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation&#146;s
products are sold primarily to grocery wholesalers, chain grocery stores, candy
distributors, mass merchandisers, chain drug stores, vending companies,
wholesale clubs, convenience stores, concessionaires and food distributors by
full-time sales representatives, food brokers and part-time retail sales
merchandisers throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. The Corporation
believes its products are sold in over 2 million retail outlets in North
America. In 2002, sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries amounted to
approximately 21 percent of the Corporation&#146;s total net sales. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation
manufactures, imports, markets, sells and distributes chocolate products in
Brazil under the HERSHEY&#146;S brand name. Additional products in Brazil
include <I>IO-IO</I> hazelnut cr&#232;me items and chocolate and confectionery
products sold under the <I>VISCONTI</I> brand name. In China, Japan, Korea and
the Philippines, the Corporation imports and/or markets selected confectionery
and grocery products. The Corporation also markets confectionery and grocery
products in over 90 countries worldwide. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation&#146;s
marketing strategy is based upon the consistently superior quality of its
products, mass distribution and the best possible consumer value in terms of
price and weight. In addition, the Corporation devotes considerable resources to
the identification, development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of new
products. The Corporation utilizes a variety of promotional programs for
customers and advertising and promotional programs for consumers. The
Corporation employs promotional programs at various times during the year to
stimulate sales of certain products. Confectionery and grocery seasonal and
holiday-related sales have typically been highest during the third and fourth
quarters of the year. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation recognizes
that the mass distribution of its confectionery and grocery  products is an important element
in maintaining sales growth and providing service to its customers. The
Corporation attempts to meet the changing demands of its customers by planning
optimum stock levels and reasonable delivery times consistent with achievement
of efficiencies in distribution. To achieve these objectives, the Corporation
has developed a distribution network from its manufacturing plants, distribution
centers and field warehouses strategically located throughout the United States,
Canada and Mexico. The Corporation uses a combination of public and contract
carriers to deliver its products from the distribution points to its customers.
In conjunction with sales and marketing efforts, the distribution system has
been instrumental in the effective promotion of new, as well as established,
products on both national and regional scales. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>From time to time, the
Corporation has changed the prices and weights of its products to accommodate
changes in manufacturing costs, the competitive environment and profit
objectives, while at the same time maintaining consumer value. The Corporation
implemented an increase in the wholesale price of its domestic standard size,
king size, variety pack, 6-pack and 10-pack lines effective January 1, 2003. The
standard size increase was approximately 11 percent. The effect of all the
increases translates into an approximate 3 percent increase over the entire
domestic product line. The last standard candy bar price increase was
implemented by the Corporation in December 1995. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The most significant raw
material used in the production of the Corporation&#146;s chocolate products is
cocoa beans. This commodity is imported principally from Far Eastern, West
African and South American equatorial regions. West Africa accounts for
approximately 70 percent of the world&#146;s crop. Cocoa beans are not uniform,
and the various grades and varieties reflect the diverse agricultural practices
and natural conditions found in the many growing areas. The Corporation buys a
mix of cocoa beans and cocoa products to meet its manufacturing requirements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The table below sets forth
 annual  average  cocoa prices as well as the highest
and lowest monthly averages for each of the calendar years indicated. The prices
are the monthly  average of the  quotations at noon of the three active  futures
trading contracts closest to maturity on the New York Board of Trade. Because of
the Corporation&#146;s forward purchasing practices discussed below, and premium
prices paid for certain varieties of cocoa beans, these average futures contract
prices are not necessarily indicative of the Corporation&#146;s  average cost of
cocoa beans or cocoa products.</FONT></P>

Source:   International Cocoa Organization Quarterly Bulletin of Cocoa Statistics</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Cocoa market prices rose sharply
during 2002 and this increase accelerated following a rebellion in the
world&#146;s largest cocoa producing country, the Ivory Coast. Continued civil
unrest in the Ivory Coast could result in further cocoa price increases. The
Corporation&#146;s costs during 2003 and beyond will not necessarily reflect
market price fluctuations because of its forward purchasing practices, premiums
and discounts reflective of relative values, varying delivery times, and supply
and demand for specific varieties and grades of cocoa beans. The
Corporation&#146;s costs for cocoa will increase substantially in 2004; however,
the Corporation expects to achieve its long-term goals for growth and
profitability by a combination of possible price increases and/or product weight
changes, improved sales mix, supply chain cost reductions and strict control of
other costs to offset potential cost increases and respond to changes in the
competitive environment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Farm Security and Rural
Investment Act of 2002, which is a six-year farm bill, impacts the prices of
sugar, corn, peanuts and milk because it sets price support levels for these
commodities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The price of sugar, the
Corporation&#146;s second most important commodity for its domestic chocolate
and confectionery products, is subject to price supports under the above
referenced farm legislation. Due to import quotas and duties imposed to support
the price of sugar established by that legislation, sugar prices paid by United
States users are currently substantially higher than prices on the world sugar
market. The average wholesale list price of refined sugar, F.O.B. Northeast, has
remained in a range of 25 &#162; to 32 &#162; per pound for the past ten years.
U.S. peanut prices declined approximately 25 percent during the fourth quarter
of 2002 due to a decrease in price support levels. Almond prices remained near
normal levels throughout 2002. Milk prices decreased in 2002 as a result of
increasing milk production. The Corporation believes that the supply of raw
materials is adequate to meet its manufacturing requirements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation attempts to
minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of its
major raw materials primarily through forward purchasing to cover future
manufacturing requirements, generally for periods from 3 to 24 months. With
regard to cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, fuel oil and certain dairy
products, price risks are also managed by entering into futures contracts. At
the present time, active futures contracts are not available for use in pricing
the Corporation&#146;s other major raw material requirements. Futures contracts
are used in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa, sugar, corn sweetener,
natural gas and certain dairy product requirements principally to take advantage
of market fluctuations which provide more favorable pricing opportunities and
flexibility in sourcing these raw materials and energy requirements. Fuel oil
futures contracts are used to minimize price fluctuations associated with the
Corporation&#146;s transportation costs. The Corporation&#146;s commodity
procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases,
but also may potentially limit the ability to benefit from possible price
decreases. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The primary effect on
liquidity from using futures contracts is associated with margin requirements
for futures contracts related to cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas,
fuel oil and certain dairy products. Cash outflows and inflows result from
original margins which are &#147;good faith deposits&#148; established by
futures exchanges to ensure that market participants will meet their contractual
financial obligations. Additionally, variation margin payments and receipts are
required when the value of open positions is adjusted to reflect daily price
movements. The magnitude of such cash inflows and outflows is dependent upon
price coverage levels and the volatility of the markets. Cash flows related to
margin requirements were significant during 2002 as a result of unusual
volatility in market prices, but historically, have not been material to the
Corporation&#146;s total working capital requirements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation manages the
purchase of forward and futures contracts by developing and monitoring
procurement strategies for each of its major commodities. These procurement
strategies, including the use of futures contracts to hedge the pricing of
cocoa, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, transportation costs and certain
dairy products, are directly linked to the overall planning and management of
the Corporation&#146;s business, since the cost of raw materials, energy and
transportation accounts for a significant portion of cost of sales. Procurement
strategies with regard to cocoa, sugar and other major raw material
requirements, energy requirements and transportation costs are developed by the
analysis of fundamentals, including weather and crop analysis, other imbalances
between supply and demand, currency exchange rates, political unrest in
producing countries and speculative influences, and by discussions with market
analysts, </FONT></P>

implemented and monitored on a regular basis by senior management. Procurement
activities for all major commodities are also reported to the Board of Directors
on a regular basis.</FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Competition</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Many of the
Corporation&#146;s brands enjoy wide consumer acceptance and are among the
leading brands sold in the marketplace. However, these brands are sold in highly
competitive markets and compete with many other multinational, national,
regional and local firms, some of which have resources in excess of those
available to the Corporation. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Trademarks</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation owns

Corporation&#146;s business. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Backlog of
Orders</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation
manufactures primarily for stock and fills customer orders from finished goods
inventories. While at any given time there may be some backlog of orders, such
backlog is not material in respect to total annual sales, nor are the changes
from time to time significant, aside from the third quarter of 1999 when a
significant backlog of orders resulted from customer service and order
fulfillment problems encountered during the start-up of new business systems and
processes. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Research and
Development</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Corporation engages in
a variety of research activities. These principally involve development of new
products, improvement in the quality of existing products, improvement and
modernization of production processes, and the development and implementation of
new technologies to enhance the quality and value of both current and proposed
product lines. Information concerning the Corporation&#146;s research and
development expense is contained in Note 1 of the Corporation&#146;s Annual
Report to Stockholders included as Appendix A to the Proxy Statement, which

domestic plants are subject to inspection by the Food and Drug Administration
and various other governmental agencies, and its products must comply with
regulations under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and with various
comparable state statutes regulating the manufacturing and marketing of food
products. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Environmental
Considerations</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In the past the Corporation
has made investments based on compliance with environmental laws and

Corporation&#146;s capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. </FONT></P>

<H2 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Employees</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>As of December 31, 2002,
the Corporation had approximately 13,700 full-time and 1,700 part-time
employees, of whom approximately 5,600 were covered by collective bargaining
agreements. A reduction of approximately 500 full-time employees occurred during
2002 as a result of a voluntary work force reduction program. A collective
bargaining agreement covering approximately 3,000 employees at two of the
Corporation&#146;s principal plants in Hershey, Pennsylvania expired in November
2001. On February 27, 2002, the employees voted not to ratify a new contract
offer, despite recommendations by their union negotiating committee and
executive board to approve the new contract. On April 17, 2002, the employees
voted again not to ratify an amended contract offer following the rejection of
that offer by the union negotiating committee. The Corporation and union
representatives continued negotiations with the assistance of a federal
mediator, but no settlement was reached and the employees went on strike
beginning April 26, 2002. The strike ended on June 6, 2002, when the employees
voted to ratify a new contract, with employees returning to work beginning on
June 8, 2002. The work stoppage did not have a material impact on the
Corporation&#146;s results of operations for 2002. The Corporation considers its
employee relations to be good. </FONT></P>

implemented by the Corporation in 1989. The IRS disallowed the interest expense
deductions associated with the underlying life insurance policies. The total
deficiency of $61.2 million, including interest, was paid to the IRS in
September 2000 to eliminate further accruing of interest. Effective October 1,
2001, the Corporation negotiated a settlement with the IRS regarding the Notice.
The resulting Closing Agreement with the IRS limited the COLI interest expense
deductions for all applicable tax years and resulted in the surrender of all
insurance  </FONT></P>

100,336 shares remaining available for future issuance under the Directors&#146;
Compensation Plan. The Directors&#146; Compensation Plan is designed to attract
and retain qualified non-employee directors and to align the interests of
non-employee directors with those of the stockholders by paying a portion of
their compensation in units representing shares of Common Stock. Directors who
are employees of the Corporation receive no remuneration for their services as
directors. RSUs are granted quarterly to each director on the first day of
January, April, July, and October on the basis of the number of shares of Common
Stock, valued at the average closing price on the New York Stock Exchange of the
Common Stock on the last three trading days preceding the grant, equal to
$10,000. While the value of the annual RSU grant is targeted at $40,000, the
actual value of the grant may be higher or lower depending upon the performance
of the Common Stock following the grant dates. A director&#146;s RSUs will vest
and be distributed upon his or her retirement from the Board. Directors may
elect to receive all or a portion of their retainer in cash or Common Stock,
although committee chair fees are paid only in cash. A director may defer
receipt of the retainer and committee chair fees until his or her retirement
from the Board. </TD>

<P><font size=2>The Board of Directors and Stockholders<BR>
Hershey Foods Corporation:</font></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Under date of January 29, 2003,
we reported on the consolidated balance sheet of Hershey Foods Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002, and the related consolidated statements of
income, cash flows and stockholders&#146; equity for the year then ended, which
are included in Hershey Foods Corporation&#146;s Proxy Statement for its 2003
Annual Meeting of Stockholders incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. In
connection with our audit of the aforementioned consolidated financial
statements, we also audited the schedule listed on page 18 in Item 15(a)(2).
This financial statement schedule is the responsibility of the
Corporation&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
this financial statement schedule based on our audit. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In our opinion, such
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein. </FONT></P>

REPORT OF PREDECESSOR AUDITOR (ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP)</FONT></H1>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The following report is a
copy of a report previously issued by Arthur Andersen LLP and has not been
reissued by Arthur Andersen LLP. This report applies to supplemental Schedule II
&#150; Valuation and Qualifying Accounts for the years ended December 31, 2001

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>To Hershey Foods Corporation:

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>We have audited, in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, the
consolidated financial statements included in Hershey Foods Corporation&#146;s
Proxy Statement for its 2002 Annual Meeting of Stockholders incorporated by
reference in this Form 10-K, and have issued our report thereon dated January
22, 2002. Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on those
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed on page 15 in Item
14(a)(2) is the responsibility of the Corporation&#146;s management and is
presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#146;s rules and is not part of the basic financial statements. This
schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all
material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole. </FONT></P>
